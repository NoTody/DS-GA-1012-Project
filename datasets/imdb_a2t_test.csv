"Worth the entertainment value of a rental, especially if you like action movies. This one features the usual car chases, fights with the great Van Damme kick style, shooting battles with the 40 shell load shotgun, and even terrorist style bombs. All of this is amusing and competently handle but there is nothing that really blows you away if you've seen your share before.<br /><br />The plot is made interesting by the inclusion of a rabbit, which is clever but practically profound. Many of the characters are heavily stereotyped -- the angry veterans, the terrified illegal aliens, the crooked cops, the indifferent feds, the bitchy tough lady station head, the crooked politician, the fat federale who looks like he was typecast as the Mexican in a Hollywood movie from the 1940s. All passably acted but again nothing peculiar.<br /><br />I thought the main villains were pretty well done and fairly well acted. By the end of the movie you certainly knew who the good guys were and weren't. There was an emotional lift as the really bad ones got their just deserts. Very simplistic, but then you weren't expecting Hamlet, right? The only thing I found really annoying was the constant cuts to VDs daughter during the last fight scene.<br /><br />Not bad. Not good. Passable 4.",0
"its a absolutely average film with a few semi-alright action sequence that make the plot seem a little better and remember the onlooker of the classic van dam films. parts of the plot don't make sense and seem to be added in to use up time. the end plot is that of a very basic type that doesn't leave the viewer guessing and any twists are obvious from the beginning. the end scene with the flask backs don't make sense as they are added in and seem to have little relevance to the history of van dam's character. not truthfully worth watching again, bit disappointed in the end production, even though it is apparent it was shot on a low budget certain shots and sections in the film are of poor oriented quality",0
"I had high hopes for this one until they changed the name to 'The Shepherd : Border Patrol, the lamest movie name ever, what was wrong with just 'The Shepherd'. This is a by the digits action flick that tips its sombrero at myriad classic Van Damme films. There is a delightful bit of action in a bar which reminded me of hard target and universal soldier but directed with no intensity or flair which is a shame. There is one great line about 'being p*ss drunk and carrying a rabbit' and some OK action scenes let down by the cheapness of it all. A lot of the moments the dialogue doesn't match the characters mouth and the stunt men fall down dead a split second before even being shot. The end fight is one of the best Van Damme struggle except the Director tries to go a bit too John Woo and fails also introducing flashbacks which no one really cares about just gets in the way of the action which is the whole point of a van Damme film.<br /><br />Not good, not bad, just average generic measures.",0
"Itzhak Florentine has made some of the optimum occidental Martial Arts action movies ever produced. In particular US Seals 2, Cold Harvest, Special Forces and Undisputed 2 are all action classics. You can tell Isaac has a real fervour for the genera and his movie are always eventful, creative and sharp affairs, with some of the best fight sequence an action fan could hope for. In particular he has found a muse with Scott Adkins, as talented an actor and action performer as you could hope for. This is borne out with Special Forces and Undisputed 2, but sadly The Parson just doesn't vivo up to their abilities.<br /><br />There is no doubt that JCVD looks better here fight-wise than he has done in years, especially in the fight he has (for pretty much no reason) in a prison cell, and in the final showdown with Scott, but look in his eyes. JCVD seems to be dead inside. There's nothing in his eyes at all. It's like he just doesn't care about anything throughout the whole film. And this is the leading guy.<br /><br />There are other murky aspects to the film, script-wise and visually, but the main issues is that you are utterly impossible to empathise with the hero of the film. A genuine embarrass as I know we all wanted this film to be as special as it genuinely could have been. There are some good bits, mostly the action scenes themselves. This film had a terrific director and action choreographer, and an awesome opponent for JCVD to face down. This could have been the one to bring the veteran action star back up to scratch in the balls-out action movie stakes.<br /><br />Sincerely a pity that this didn't happen.",0
"Blind Date (Columbia Pictures, 1934), was a decent film, but I have a few issues with this film. First of all, I don't fault the actors in this film at all, but more or less, I have a difficulties with the script. Also, I understand that this film was made in the 1930's and people were looking to escape reality, but the scripts accomplished Ann Sothern's character look vulnerable. She kept going back and forth between suitors and I felt as though she should have stayed with Paul Kelly's character in the end. He truly did care about her and her family and would have done anything for her and he did by giving her up in the end to fickle Neil Hamilton who in my opinion was only out for a good time. Paul Kelly's characters, although a workaholic was a man of integrity and genuinely loved Kath (Ann Sothern) as opposing to Neil Hamilton, while he did like her a lot, I didn't see the depth of love that he had for her character. The production values were great, but the script could have used a little work.",0
"I saw the Magnate Videos VHS of this. That's another one of those former 1980s merchants whose catalogue I wishing I had!<br /><br />This movies was quite poorest. Yet retitled ""Don't Look in the Attic,"" the main admonition that is recur in this is ""Don't go to the cottage."" Jen getting on the rationale of the cottage is a unfavorable notions. A nature doesn't go into the attic until an hours into the films, and actually should have played it ago because of what is learning there.<br /><br />The movie launches in Nantes, Italian in the 1950s. Two men are fighting, and a woman is telling them the vila is making them do it. One man mata the other, then regretted it, and the woman pulls out the shiv and stabs him with it. She flees the cottage, and after she's left a wheelchair moves by itself (what's the point of that?), but when in the jardin a hand comes up through the grounding and drags he into the tierra.<br /><br />From there, it's the presented day, thirty years later. There's a s√©ance that appears suddenly and doesn't appear to have anything to do with the films. The children of the woman from the prologue are inheriting the house. The main daughter is played by the same actor who played her mother. During least one of the two men from the prologue seems to reoccur as another character too. She's haunted by some warnings not to go to the villa, but they all do, since if they do not use it, they forfeit it. People die. A lawyer who has won all his cases tries to investigate a little. The ending is pretty poor. Why was the family cursed? An unfortunately boring kino.<br /><br />There's an amusing small-print disclaimer on the back of the video box that reads ""The scenes depicted on this packaging may be an artist's impression and may not necessarily represent actual scenes from the film."" In this case, the cover of the box is an illustration that does more or less accurately depict the aforementioned woman dragged underground scene, although there are two hands, and the woman is different. It's true, sometimes the cover art has nothing to do with the movie. I also recall seeing a reviewer who had a bad movie predictor scale, in which movies with illustrations on the cover instead of photos got at least one point for that.",0
"Now, I LOVE Italian horror films. The cheesier they are, the better. However, this is not cheesy Italian. This is week-old sandwiches sauce with dripping dumplings. It is dilettante hora on all levels. There is no suspense, no abomination, with just a few drops of blood scattered around to remind you that you are in fact watching a horror film. The ""special influences"" consist of the lights changing to red whenever the phantom (or whatever it was supposed to be) is around, and a string pulling bed sheets up and down. Oooh, can you feel the chills? The DVD quality is that of a VHS transfer (which genuinely contribute the film more than hurts it). The dubbing is below even the lowest ""negative Italian movie"" norms and I gave it one star just because the dialog is so comic! And what do we discover when she finally DOES look in the attic (in a scene that is daylight one minute and night the next)...well, I won't spoil it for anyone who really wants to see, but let's just say that it isn't very ""novel""!",0
"This inexpensive, grainy-filmed Ltalian film is about a couple of inheritors of a mansion in the Italian countryside who head up to the house to stay, and then find themselves getting killed off by phantoms of people killed in that house.<br /><br />I wasn't impressed by this. It wasn't truly that horrible, mostly just the way a inexpensive Italian filmmaking should be. A girl, her two cousins, and one cousin's girlfriend, head to this huge house for some reason (I couldn't figure out why) and are staying there, cleaning up and checking out the place. Nature come in and out of the film, and it's rather boring at dots, and the majority of mortality are rather precipitated. The girlfriend is hit by a car when fleeing the house after having a dream of her death, and the scene is quite good, but then matters get slower again, until a confusing end, when the male cousins are killed together in some weird way, and this weirdo guy (I couldn't figure out who he was during the movie, or maybe I just don't remember) goes after this one girl, attacking her, until finally this other girl kills him off. Loathes to give away the ending, but ah well. The female cousin decides to stay at the house and watch over it, and they show scenes of her living there years later. The end. You really aren't missing anything, and anyway, you probably won't find this anywhere, so lucky you.",0
"Dr Stephens (Micheal Harvey) runs a mental asylum. He has a different approach to the insane. He conducts unorthodox methods of treatment. He treats everyone like family, there are no locks on the patients doors and he lets some of the inmates act out their twisted fantasies. He lets Sergeant Jaffee (Hugh Feagin) dress and act as a soldier and Harriet (Camilla Carr) be a mother to a doll, including letting her put it to bed in a cot. Dr. Stevens is outside letting Judge Oliver W. Cameron (Gene Ross) chop a log up with an axe, it turns out to be a bad move as once Dr. Stevens back is turned the Judge plants the axe in his shoulder. Soon after Nurse Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik) arrives at the Sanitarium having arranged an interview with Dr. Stevens about a possible job. She is met by the head Nurse, Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Weenick as Anne McAdams) and is offered a trail position. She gets to know and becomes well liked among the patients. However things eventually start to turn sour, the phone lines are cut, an old lady named Mrs. Callingham (Rhea MacAdams) has her tongue cut out and she starts to get a strange feeling that things just aren't right somehow. Then, one night all the Sanitariums dark secrets are forcefully revealed. Produced and directed by S.f. Brownrigg this film has a magnificent central brainchild which builds into a cool twist ending, but ultimately is a bit of a chore to sit through because of it's low budget restrictions and a rather slow script by Tim Pope. There are just too multiple long dull stretches of dialogue by the inmates, not a lot really arrives until the final twenty odd minutes. The film has no real visual quality as it's set entirely in the Sanitarium and it's grounds which is basically just a big insipid house in the middle of nowhere. There's no graphic gore in it, a few splashes of blood here and there and thats yer lot. There's a bit of nudity, but like the gore not much. The acting is pretty strong, especially Holotik and Weenick. The pictured is flat and unexciting and I can't even remember what the music was like. The twist ending is great, but it just takes far too long to get to it. A film that had a lot of potential that was probably held back by it's budget. OK I guess, but I think it would have worked a lot better if the story had been turned into a half an hour 'Tales form the Crypt' episode.",0
"I of course saw the previews for this at the beginning of some other Lion's Gate extravaganza, so of course it was only the best parts and therefore looked intriguing. And it is, to a point. A young college student (Sarah)is finding riddles all over the place and is becoming obsessed with answering them, and in doing so she's unwittingly becoming involved in some game. Now that's rather enigmatic right there but sadly it all gets quite bemused and becomes so complicated that the viewer (like myself) will most likely become frustrated. Characters appear with little introduction and you're not really sure who they are or why Sarah knows them or is hanging out with them. All of this has something to do with this woman who tried to drown a young boy years ago and her reason for that was that it's ""all part of the design"". In realism, it's all part of the ""very incomplete hyphen"" and when the film is over you'll find yourself feeling that you've lost about an hour and a half of your life that you want back for more productive uses of your time, like cleaning the bathroom, for instance. 4 out of 10.",0
"I gave this a 3 out of a possible 10 celebrity.<br /><br />If you like wastage your time watching an anorexic actor, in this film it's Carly Pope, behaving iike a ditz, don't irritate.<br /><br />Carly Pope plays Sara Novak, a young college student, who becomes intrigued with a game of riddles, that leads her down into subway tunnels underneath the city - a dangerous thing for even a well-armed man to go in alone.<br /><br />There are various intrigues in the film -- a weirdo classmate who is apparently stalking Sara, a cynical shopkeeper who runs some kind of offbeat hole-in-the-wall establishment that appears to be located in the back alley of a ghetto, a nerdish dim-wit that hangs around the cynic's shop, and a woman named Emily Gray, who is back in prison.<br /><br />Sara's father is a lawyer who is handling Emily Gray's case. <br /><br />A few years back, Emily Gray attempted to drown a 12 year old boy. Emily was put in a mental hospital for 5 years, and for some cockeyed reason they let her out again, even though it is obvious she is still dangerously deranged.<br /><br />The only explanation Amelie has ever given for her crime is: I never sinned.<br /><br />It's all portion of the designs.<br /><br />Well, my friend, don't expect to ever get any better explanation than that, because you won't.",0
"I was looking forward to this movie. Trustworthy actors, interesting plot. Great atmosphere then ????? IF you are going to attempt something that is meant to encapsulate the meaning of life. First. Know it. OK I did not expect the directors or writers to actually know the meaning but I thought they may have offered crumbs to peck at and treats to add fuel to the fire-Which! they almost did. Things I didn't get. A woman wandering around in dark places and lonely car parks alone-oblivious to the consequences. Great riddles that fell by the wayside. The promise of the knowledge therein contained by the original so-called criminal. I had no problem with the budget and enjoyed the suspense. I understood and can wax lyrical about the butthead and found Adrian Pauls role crucial and penetrating and then ????? Basically the story line and the script where good up to a point and that point was the last 10 minutes or so. What? Run out of ideas! Such a compassion that this movie had to let us down so sorely. It may not comprehend the meaning and I really did not expect the writers to understand it but I was hoping for an intellectual, if not witty ride and got a bump in the routes",0
"<br /><br />Never ever take a film just for its good looking title.<br /><br />Although it all starts well, the film suffers the same imperfections you see in B-films. Its like at a certain moment the writer does not any more how to end the film, so he ends it in a way nobody suspect it thinking this way he is ingenious.<br /><br />A film to be listed on top of the refuse list.<br /><br />",0
"The most beneficial dots in this film were the credits (text style) and some moments in Ice-T's acting. The story-line; two rival gangs having to fight it out, with the sub-plots of betrayal, power and change are well wear plots but in this case painful(very) to wade through. The decrepit landscape, which added slight believability in places, and shady lighting, always entertained from any interest/identification with the characters (the shine off of the actress's forehead/nose was blinding, not to mention other scenes with the same problem.) Not yet half way into the film I want to know more about how and why it came about as bucked to what was going on on screen. A disillusionment if you have saw Ice-T in other roles. Laurels to other actors/actresses who seemed to get into their roles despite the weak direction; Corrupt's side kick and the other restaurant worker.",0
"I utterly appreciated The Wrecking Crew (1999), which was the last of the three movie in this serials (the first being Urban Jeopardy (1999) which I've yet to see). I know it was baaaaad, but the three leads did a pretty decent job, all things considered.<br /><br />This, yet, was truthfully abhorrent. Ice-T was fearsome, and he's the grower! Can't say I've ever heard of Silkk The Shocker (who apparently never learnt how to spell), but his performance was one of the meanest I've ever seen in a movie.<br /><br />Miss Jones did pretty well in her small role, though she later went on to make some atrocious, racist ""jokes"" on her radio show after the SE Asian tsunami (plus other occasions sadly). Way to go, girl...<br /><br />No-one else comes out with any credit. Strangely, TJ Storm and Ernie Hudson (who are both pretty negative here) are far better in The Wrecking Crew, which was accomplished, along with Urban Perils, at the same time as Corrupt. How that works, I don't know.<br /><br />I'm going to tries the Ice-T remark now, to see whether he apologises for the film, or tries to make us think it's a great piece of film-making.",0
"Beware, My Lovely (1952) Dir: Harry Horner <br /><br />Production: The Filmmakers/RKO Radio Pictures<br /><br />Credulity-straining thriller from the pioneering producer team of Collier Young and Ida Lupino, aka The Filmmakers (with Lupino pitching in with some uncredited direction). <br /><br />Robert Ryan is the 'peril' and Ida Lupino is the 'woman' in this input in the 'woman in peril' style film. Ryan plays Howard Wilton, a tightly-wound crazed handyman drifter (noooo, Ryan? I know, hard to believe). Lupino is the lonely war widow, Helen Gordon, who hires Howard to do some work around her house. Items going downhill from there as Howard makes Helen a prisoner in her own home. <br /><br />Howard has a squalid secret, not that he could reveal it. You see, awareness is a real challenge for him. Maintaining it, that is. He has an unfortunate habit of coming to and finding his employers dead. This is part of the film's issues. The nature of Howard's psychosis is so extreme that it is nearly impossible to believe that he's been free to roam from town to town unobstructed, even in the year 1918 (when the film is set). He can't remember anything that happened ten minutes ago. His violent, threatening, anti-social tendencies are set off by the smallest and most common of things (a young girl flirting, inadequacies involving the war, due to his being rejected for service). I don't know how he even made it past the interview with Helen. There are other implausibilities. If you were locked in your house with a madman, but nonetheless left on your own for periods of time, couldn't you figure out a way to escape? <br /><br />Ryan, I think, is conquered by the materials. It feels like he's overplaying his hand. His series of tics and spasms and the tightly coiled bursts of craziness all have a been-there, done-that robotic feel to them. At this point in his career he'd probably played this character, to some degree, ten times and it shows. We are spurred to empathize with Howard (I didn't) through shown bits of humanity, like him being stopped in his tracks by a music box and his relating to a group of children who won't judge him. Lupino just has to act frazzled and in distress, which she is more than capable of and does. <br /><br />The picture had one thing going for it; what would be the eventual resolution of the conflict? So naturally there was a disappointing ending that was abrupt and ineffective. <br /><br />Of slight interest was a recurring motif where the camera would catch Howard's reflection (in mirrors, water, Christmas tree decorations). This indicated something going on, or about to go on, in his head. Horner (1953's Vicki), who made his reputation in production design, does a fine job of making the house feel like a prison. Credit too, the always reliable RKO art department for the work on the house. In the end, sub-standard work from the principals, who all have much better films to their credit. <br /><br />*¬Ω out of 4",0
"Talented writer Alvin Sargent sadly cannot get any engaging ideas kitchen in this artificial trifle about a wayward mother and her mature teenage daughter trying to make their lives work in Los Angeles despite mom's flighty behavior. Apart from several good sequences, I didn't quite buy Susan Sarandon as a flake (she's too intrinsically smart and focused to be passed off as this devil-may-care lady), and her naturally grounded personality is a wicked fitting for the role of an irresponsible parent. Natalie Portman fares much better as her kid, and yet there's a terrifying aloofness to her work (and some of her scenes, such as the one where she asks a boy to strip, are misguided and uncomfortable to watch). Definitely not an incompetent slice, ""Anywhere But Here"" does have moments that work, but it isn't an embraceable film, nor has it proved to be an important one. ** from ****",0
"An Italia/American co-production co-starring Linda Blair and David 'The Hoff' Hasselhoff: how wo any fan of trashy horror resist such a treat?<br /><br />Good, based on the uneventful, greatly monotonous, and utterly nonsensical first forty minutes or so, I would have say 'very easily'; fortunately, however, matters do finally gets a tad more amusing with the intro of several inventive death scenes, and for those lucky enough to find an uncut copy, a smattering of nudity too (sadly, my copy was optically edited to abolition such onslaught material).<br /><br />The Hoff celebrity as Gary, a photography who accompanies his beautiful girlfriend Lesley (Leslie Cumming) to a run-down hotel on a seemingly deserted island in order to take pictures for her latest project, a ledger about sorcerers; whilst there, thwarted Gary also hopes to try and cure a bad case of blue balls by relieving Leslie of her virginity.<br /><br />His plans for nookie are scuppered, however, by the unexpected arrival of property developers Freddie and Rose Brooks (Robert Champagne and Annie Ross), their pregnant daughter Jane (Blair), son Tommy (Michael Manchester), pretty nymphomaniac architect Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland), and estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth), who have come to inspect the island's hotel.<br /><br />After explaining their unexpected presence on the island, Gary and Lesley are welcome by the property's new owners, and when a violent storm suddenly picks up, making it perilous to return to the mainland, everyone agrees to spend the nocturne in the old building. Regrettably, unbeknownst to the hotel's new guests, the place is also home to the geist of an wicked magician (Hildegard Knef), who require human sacrifices in order to bring herself back to life. One by one, victims are pulled into a swirling red vortex (which is guaranteed to provide unintentional grin), before meeting a terrible fate.<br /><br />Nos of this makes much sense, and the acting is vile (Manchester as Tommy is particularly bad, whilst Hasselhoff proves to be one of the better performers, which speaks quantities about the others), but those audiences who make it past the dreary first half are rewarded with some pretty decent moments of gore: Rose has her lips sewn together, before being roasted alive in a fireplace; Jerry is crucified and burnt alive; Linda is tortured by hags and impaled on a swordfish(!!); Freddie's veins pulsate and erupt in geysers of blood; and Gary gets stabbed in the back.<br /><br />Oh, and Leslie is raped by a guy with no lips and Blair gets possessed (again).",0
"Oh my... bad dresses, worse synth music and the worse: David Hasselhoff. The 80's are back with vengeance in Witchery, an American-Italian co-production, helmed by infamous Joe 'D'Amato on the production side and short-careered director (thank heavens for small miracles) Fabrizio Laurenti directing . Marketed as a kind of sequel to Sam Raimi's Evil Dead series in Italy (that was dubbed ""La Casa"" in there), Witchery furnishes some modest gore groceries and negative acting.<br /><br />A mix of ghost story, possessions and witchcraft, the film bounces clueless from scene to another without letting some seriously wooden actors and hilarious day and night mix-ups slow it's progress to expectable ending, topped with some serious WTF surprise climax. (I just love the look on her face...) Staggeringly Laurenti manages to gather some suspense and air of malice in few - very few - scenes; unluckily for him, these few glimpses of mild movie hallucinogenic going down soon and effectively.<br /><br />The plus sides are seasoned, when the gora hits the fan. This ministry is abundantly effective and entertaining in that classic latex and red paint style of the 80's Italo-gore, when things were made 100% hand-made and as shockingly and vivid as modest budgets could allow. I could only watch with sadistic glee and few laughters all the over-the-top ways that obnoxious characters (and actors) got mangled and misused, one by one. I only felt sorry for Linda Blair, who apparently haven't been let to try any other than that good old possessed girl / woman role ever in his career, or so it looks like when checking out his filmography.<br /><br />Well, folks - not much more to tell, and even less to tell home about. Don't expect too much when spending some rainy afternoon with this, and probably you'll experience at least some mild fun. It also helps if your rotten little heart pounds in the beat of 80's euro gore horror. And speaking of hearts - every movie that has David Hasselhoff getting skewered by a sizeable metal object and bleeding heavily around the room and corridors, MUST have it's one on the right place.<br /><br />This is my truth - what is yours?",0
"There are many different versions of this one floating around, so make sure you can locate one of the unrated copies, otherwise some gore and one scene of nudity might be missing. Some versions also omit most of the opening sequence and other bits here and there. The cut I saw has the on-screen title WITCHCRAFT: EVIL ENCOUNTERS and was released by Shriek Show, who maintain the original US release title WITCHERY for the DVD release. It's a nice-looking print and seems to have all of the footage, but has some cropping/aspect ratio issues. In Italy, it was released as LA CASA 4 (WITCHCRAFT). The first two LA CASA releases were actually the first two EVIL DEAD films (retitled) and the third LA CASA was another film by the same production company (Filmirage), which is best known here in America as GHOSTHOUSE. To make matters even more confusing, WITCHERY was also released elsewhere as GHOSTHOUSE 2. Except in Germany, where GHOSTHOUSE 2 is actually THE OGRE: DEMONS 3. OK, I better just shut up now. I'm starting to confuse myself!<br /><br />Regardless of the title, this is a very hit-or-miss terror endeavors. Some of it is good, some of it isn't. I actually was into this film for the first half or so, but toward the end it became a senseless confusion. A large, vacant hotel located on an island about 50 miles from Boston is the setting, as various people get picked off one-by-one by a German- speaking witch (Hildegard Knef). Photographer Gary (David Hasselhoff), who wants to capture ""Witch Light,"" and his virginal writer girlfriend (Leslie Cumming), who is studying witchcraft, are shacking up at the hotel without permission. Along comes real estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth), who's showing off the property to potential buyers Rose (Annie Ross) and Freddie (Robert Champagne) Brooks. Also tagging along are their children; pregnant grown daughter Jane (Linda Blair) and very young son Tommy (Michael Manchester), as well as oversexed architect Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland - Hasselhoff's wife at the time). Once everyone is inside, their boat driver is killed (hung) and the boat disappears, so they find themselves trapped and basically at the mercy of the ""Lady in Black.""<br /><br />So what can you expect to find here? Plenty of unpleasantries! One of the characters has their lips sewn shut and is then hung upside down in the fireplace and accidentally slow-roasted by the rest of the cast. There's also a crucifixion, witches eating a dead baby, a swordfish through the head, someone set on fire, a possession, a Sesame Street tape recorder, the virgin getting raped by some demon, a guys veins bulging and exploding thanks to voodoo doll pokes and some other stuff. From a technical standpoint, it's a nice-looking film with pretty good cinematography, a decent score and good gore effects. The hotel/island setting is also pretty nice. Blair (particularly at the end) and Ross both seem like they're having fun and Knef is great as the evil witch. Even though people like to ridicule Hasselhoff these days, he's not bad in his role, either.<br /><br />On the down side, despite all the gore, the film seems somewhat dull and it gets monotonous after about an hour. The supernatural themes are muddled and confusing, too. When characters are being swept into the witches lair to be tortured and killed, the filmmakers unwisely decided to superimpose the screaming actors over some silly looking red spiral vortex effect that looks supremely cheesy. And the witch lair itself is vacant and cheaply designed with unfinished lumber. And while most of the cast is at least decent, a few of the performances (particularly the ""actress"" who plays Hasselhoff's girlfriend and the kid) are so bad they're constantly distracting.",0
"""Witchery"" might just be the most incoherent and lamentably scripted horror movie of the 80's but, blithely enough, it has a few compensating qualities like fantastic gore effects, an exhilarating musical score and some terrific casting choices. Honestly the screenplay doesn't make one iota of sense, but who cares when Linda Blair (with an exploded hairstyle) portrays yet another girl possessed by evil powers and David Hasselhof depicts a hunky photographer (who can't seem to get laid) in a movie that repeatedly features bloody voodoo, sewn-shut lips, upside down crucifixions, vicious burnings and an overused but genuinely scary tune. Eight random people are gathered together on an abandoned vacation resort island off the coast of Massachusetts. The young couple is there to investigate the place's dark history; the dysfunctional family (with a pregnant Linda Blair even though nobody seems to bother about who the father is and what his whereabouts are) considers re-opening the hotel and the yummy female architect simply tagged along for casual sex. They're forced to stay the night in the ramshackle hotel and then suddenly the previous landlady ¬ñ an aging actress or something who always dresses in black ¬ñ starts taking them out in various engrossing ways. Everything is somehow related to the intro sequence showing a woman accused of witchery jump out of a window. Anyway, the plot is definitely of minor importance in an Italian horror franchise that started as an unofficial spin-off of ""The Evil Dead"". The atmosphere is sometimes unsettling and the make-up effects are definitely the most superior element of the entire film. There's something tremendously morbid and unsettling about staring at a defenseless woman hanging upside down a chimney and waiting to get fried.",0
"Witchy Hildegard Knef traps a group of people in an isolated hotel and picks them off one by one in twisted, disgusting ways. I thought I'd seen it all until one unfortunate man here is crucified and then has his head set on fire. Hildy is quite the prankster too: she takes a nagging harpy and sews her mouth shut...then hangs her upside down in the chimney just in time for a roaring fire! ""Witchery"" made me unwell. It made my eyes hurt. I was ready to write it off as the hardest movie ever-ever-ever made by otherwise proficient people...until the finale. I have to admit I loved the ending. It involves a boy and his toy tape-recorder cornered by Linda Blair looking fantastically possessed. The scene only lasts for about a minute and the movie's over, but you know that old saying: ""If you've got a great ending, people will forgive you for just about anything!""",0
"This film features two of my favorite guilty pleasures. Sure, the effects are nonsensical, the story confused, but just watching Hasselhoff in his Knight Rider days is always fun. I especially like the old hotel they used to shoot this in, it added to what little suspense was mustered. Give it a 3.",0
"I watched this movie exclusively for the setting. It was filmed in an old hotel that a friend owns shares of. The plot was foreseeable, the acting was mediorcre at best, the scares were all gross-outs, not true scares.<br /><br />I don't remember much of the plot, and I think that's because there wasn't much of one to recall. They didn't even use the hotel to it's fullest potential...The beach are wondrous and the hotel is situated on a peninsula. At low tide, you can walk almost 1/4 mile into the bay, which is actually an eerie sight first thing in the morning or late at night when the wind is howling through the cracks.<br /><br />The best way to see this movie is with the remote in your hand so you can fast forward through the action (and I'm using that term loosly)scenes and pause at the beauty of the environs!",0
"This only gets bashed because it stars David Hasselhoff. Well, then let me bash it to. Compared to the garbage they call horror coming out nowadays, this film isn't too bad. It has the wondrous Lesley Cumming. She is super hot, but can't talk very well. There is a great scene with her when she is supernaturally raped. She shows off her nice body. Linda Blair does nothing here as well as Hasselhoff. 3/10",0
I and a friend rented this movie. We both found the movie soundtrack and production technologies to be lagging. The movie's plot emerged to towed on throughout with little amaze in the ending. We both agreed that the movie could have been compressed into roughly an hour giving it more suspense and moving plot.,0
"generally speaking I don't make negative comments on here. But since this is a celebratory piece, I don't want you to waste your time when you could see something else that might not be playing again.<br /><br />I thought the players were pretty negative. For instance, they totally didn't play off each other, rather, they waited to RECITE their lines which were pretty pauper to begin with. The dialogue sounded really forced. Norman or whatever his name tried, or so it would appear, to be witty and biting in the lines he chose but just fell really short.<br /><br />After words he asked if anyone saw the ending coming and some people were all ""yea"", and he all but called them liars. Look there were so many clues, the biggest being a briefcase full of cash for a $500 an hour whore. I mean the john gave her at least 20g's... tell tale sign. Now no you couldn't see exactly what was going to happen but by the time the twist actually occurred, I for one, didn't even care. I was just pleased to got out of there. I asked him which draft he shot and he said 8.1, maybe next time he will wait to shoot 'til 15.3 cause this needed a lot of work.<br /><br />But he seemed like a fairly nice guy, he is making his own films, he'll probably get better and I hope he does, not in a snotty way either, I mean it, I wish him luck. Just remember, this is just my opinion.",0
"1983's ""Frightmare"" is an inquisitive little film. The headmaster seems to be tempting to combine the atmosphere of classic '30s/'40s style horror movies with the shock factor of the then-exploding '80s slasher genre. It isn't totally successful (mostly due to very obvious budgetary restraints, and the less-than-professional caliber of its cast of young actors) but it still has its times, mostly due to the classy performance (classier than the movie deserves) by the late German actor Ferdinand Mayne, who plays an aging old time horror movie star (ala Vincent Price) named ""Conrad Ratzoff."" At the beginning of the movie we meet the has-been horror star as he's shooting a commercial for dentures and we quickly learn that ol' Konrad is a bit of a hoity-toity, prima donna jerk-off. Just when you think he couldn't be any more un-likable, the commercial director berates Conrad for blowing a take for the umpteenth time and the old goat pushes him off a balcony to his death. Nice, huh? Conrad then visits some fans at a college campus horror movie club, unfortunately he suffers a heart attack in the middle of his speech to them and eventually ends up back at his mansion waiting to die. Still feisty even at Death's door, he manages to do away with a despised business associate by smothering him with a pillow before he finally kicks the bucket himself. Conrad is then laid to rest in true Hollywood style in a high tech neon tomb with video screens above the casket, which will play personal video messages from Conrad himself for visitors who enter to pay their respects.<br /><br />It is at this point that the kids from the college Horror Movie Society decide to pay Conrad's grave an after hours visit, breaking into the tomb and taking his body back home with them for an all night party. (Not exactly my idea of fun, but hey, these are characters in an '80s horror film. Logic has no place here.) The college kids spend the evening having dinner with Conrad's body seated in a place of honor, posing for photos with it and even dancing around the room with it, before parking Conrad and his coffin in the attic, planning to return him to his crypt in the morning. In the meantime, Mrs. Ratzoff, distraught over the theft of her husband's body, has called in a psychic friend to try and ""reach"" Conrad through a seance. You can pretty much figure out the rest from here. Since Conrad wasn't a very nice guy in life, it's not much of a stretch to assume that he won't be any friendlier in death. Psychic Lady makes contact with Conrad and he re-awakens in predictably ticked off fashion, then spends the rest of the movie strolling around the corridors of the students' ridiculously huge house, picking off the young grave robbers one by one. This is where the movie falls apart. Endless scenes of teens wandering around empty hallways saying ""Hello? Is anyone there?"" are intercut with occasional bursts of violence (we do get a pretty gnarly decapitation scene, which is the highlight of the movie) before the last two survivors finally figure out (WAY later than any semi-intelligent people would have figured out the same thing...but again, we're in an '80s horror film!) that the only way to stop the mayhem is to get Conrad's body back to its crypt where it belongs. The sluggish pacing is padded out with a lot of weird lighting and dry ice fog effects backed by a soundtrack made up almost entirely of sound effects rather than music(thunder, moans and groans, howls, etc.) that becomes severely annoying after a while.<br /><br />I can't really recommend ""Frightmare"" to anyone who didn't grow up watching cheap movies like this on late night cable back in the '80s. ""Modern Horror"" fans will doubtlessly find ""Frightmare"" incredibly slow moving and goofy. If you came of age in that magical decade, however, you may get a blast of nostalgia from ""Frightmare."" Fans of Jeffrey (""Re-Animator"") Combs may also want to check it out, as the future Dr. West appears in an early role here as one of the unlucky film students.<br /><br />I will advise the reader to avoid the version of this film on the EastWestDVD label (paired with Roy Ward's ""Vault of Horror"" and sold at dollar stores) because the print quality is terrible. I'm told the film has gotten a deluxe release via the fine folks at Troma, which seems appropriate. If you're a Troma kind of person then ""Frightmare"" will be right up your alley.",0
"I don't get it! The teenage leads in ""Horror Star"" allegedly all are devoted horror fans, yet when their favorite idol (Conrad Radzoff) passes away, they dig up his corpse and do all sorts of disrespectful stuff with it, like disco-dancing it around the house and throw food leftovers at it. That doesn't sound like something real horror fans would do, now does it? I'm a overwhelming horror breather and I tremendously idolize departed icons like Vincent Price, Peter Cushing and Boris Karloff, but it would never come to my mind to ridicule their memory. No wonder Konrad comes back from the dead ¬ñ admittedly, after a s√©ance ¬ñ to wipe them all off the face of the earth! Mr. Radzoff already wasn't known for his friendliness in life, since he occasionally killed the directors that disagreed with his visions, and even after his death he suffers from a tremendous ego. Even inside his tomb there are video messages to petrify possible visitors and the group of teenagers will vividly experience that he similarly enjoys the murdering business outside his film sets. ""Horror Star"" (a.k.a. ""Frightmare"" and ""Body Snatchers"") is a pretty lame 80's horror flick, but there are a handful of cheesy & gory highlights to enjoy. The film mainly suffers from its own stupid plot, since no one ¬ñ not even a film school student ¬ñ is stupid enough to steal a recently buried corpse and actually think he'll get away with it, and there are too many tedious moments to struggle through. Conrad's video-speeches from beyond the grave are overly talkative and definitely undermine the tension, but on the other hand his killing methods are pleasingly inventive. One teenager enjoys the experience of getting cremated alive and another one (Jeffrey Combs in one of his first roles!) loses his head in a delightful decapitation sequence. In the absolute messiest sequence, a poor girl' head is crushed by a coffin. Writer/director Norman Thaddeus Vane wanted to bring homage to vintage horror cinema and he obviously how to make film look sinister. The locations and scenery are great, but Vane lacked the necessary funds to provide his film with a proper continuity and editing-job. The acting performances are overall decent, with Ferdy Mayne (imitating Christopher Lee) and Jeffrey Combs delivering the most memorable roles. ""Horror Star"" can hardly be called a must-see or even a good film, but it's worth tracking down in case you're an admirer of enthusiastically made B-horror.",0
"Conrad Radzoff(Ferdy Mayne), a hammy cult icon, dies from a heart ailment(not before disposing of an ungrateful assistant and TV commercial director, both of whom disrespected him with showers of insults). His body is removed from his mausoleum by some film students(they wish to ""invite him to dinner""..they are quite big fans). What these kids(..including a young Jeffrey Combs)don't expect is that Radzoff will be resurrected by a medium to wreak havoc on those who removed him from his place of rest.<br /><br />The list of violent acts include Radzoff pulling one guy's tongue out, setting a woman on fire, elevating a casket which crushes a woman's face, decapitates one fellow, and cremates another guy alive in a casket. A genuinely freaky soundtrack and irksome fog wraps around Radzoff's ghoulish activity.<br /><br />Daft hokum from Troma is limited by a very, very low budget and slowwwwww cadence. The film feels a lot longer than it is. The film isn't really that gory and we can almost see much violence because the film is often too damn dark. At times, Radzoff is an ominous presence, yet at other times he just looks real silly.",0
"One of the last surviving horror screen greats - Conrad Radzoff - dies and has his body placed in a mausoleum with televised-before-death snippets of the great Conrad greeting you as you visit. Unfortunately for him and his captors, Conrad's body is ""borrowed"" by a gang of four boys and three girls and taken to a huge manor where they drink with him, toast him, dance with him, laugh with and at him, and then put him to bed in a casket which just happens to by lying in a room upstairs. News of the missing body reaches Radzoff's widow and her friend(who happens to be proficient in the black arts) and she holds some kind of ceremonies that brings Conrad back to life so he can, in his own words, get ""an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."" Well, Frightmare is an interesting ""unfavorable"" filmmaking. Sure, it is cheap. The sets look like they were borrowed(which I am sure they were). The special effects and blood and guts are done liberally and with little credibility. The acting is average to below average with a few exceptions. Jeffrey Combs of Re-Animator fame is in tow, but really he does little in this rather thankless role as a horror obsessed teen that needs to steal a dead man's body for kicks. None of the ""kids"" except the pretty girl playing Meg is any buena. Nita Talbot plays the ""friend"" of the Radzoffs with withering interest. Also, look for the big - I mean big - guy that plays the policeman. That is Porky himself of Porkys fame. But joyfully for all of us, one performance does rise above the material. Ferdy Mayne, an oft overlooked actor from Germany who had Christopher Lee features and did star as a vampire in The Fearless Vampire Killers, does a more than commendable job as the aging horror icon in public life and a real demon of a man in private life. Conrad Radzoff in a unfavourable human being in life, living solely for his own pleasures and we see him kill twice before he is even dead(obviously none of the swinging teens at that point). Mayne is able to look very royal, speak very elegantly, and convey jeopardy with ease. If for no other reason, one should see Frightmare for his performance. I do; albeit, believe that when they showed black and white clips of Radzoff that they used Christopher Lee footage(anyone have any thoughts?). Anyway, one can guess what happens and it does indeed: Radzoff goes out and goes after the kids that disturbed his peace. Again, the formula is trite and overused. The acting for the most part is anemic, and the direction oh so ridiculous. But Mayne gives a good performance in a sea of ineptitude. Definitely worth a little peek. Watching Mayne keep popping up on screens in his mausoleum brought a wry smile to my lips each time.",0
"My parents used to rent a lot of horror movies when I was a child. We loved watching them even when they were bad they made for some enjoyment. This was one such movie, kind of hard to reviewed as I have only seen it the one time as a child, but it is not anything I want to track down again so I can do a more in-depth review. The histories has some old horror protagonist legend died. I seem to remember he acted a bit like an over the top Vincent Price, without being likable and classy. He commits murders and dies, but what is this? Is the movie over already? No, as some kids for some reason snag the body and are prepared for a fun night of being killed by the chatham from beyond the grave. I remember the murders were nothing all that special after the first couple and I remember this movie was somewhat disappointed. Appeared to have a good assumption, but it just faulted to make the goods as more cool kills were needed and that wondrous horror protagonist needed to add a bit to his repertoire.",0
"Frightmare started with a horror movie icon killing a director and then his servant before he is laid to rest. This icon, who has some Christopher Lee qualities to him, then continues to haunt those around him when a group of horror film society students steal his corpse from the mausoleum he is in.<br /><br />The first ten minutes is well-filmed, good handwriting and lots of potential for bloodthirsty havoc. But the film drags in the middle (although thankfully not as much as ""House of Death"") and never really gets that initial spurt of energies back.<br /><br />Lots of the deaths are confusing, as they seem to have people just falling over scared when they see a floating coffin or other odd things. Twice we see poisonous gas being used. But the box promises that this horror star will be the embodiment of all the monsters he has played. Boy, is that false advertising, unless he spent his career playing boring old men who take naps and watch ""Matlock"".<br /><br />The general principle of the film is decent: terror society kids stealing a corpse of a dead icon. A modern equivalent (digging up Vincent Price or Peter Cushing) would make a great film. Maybe a remake is in order if that wouldn't be too disrespectful. Sometimes theory doesn't come across as well in asks, and this film furnishes that case.<br /><br />The only redeeming quality of this film (besides the beginning) is the brief appearance of a very young Jeffrey Combs. I saw him and thought ""that's Jeffrey Combs"" but felt I was mistaken as the box never mentioned him. But sure sufficient, Combs was present. (A note to this movie's film-makers: mention Combs on the cover of the DVDS, you'll sell more copies if if you would be deceiving customers.) If you're a Jeffrey Combs die-hard, check out this early role. Otherwise, I cannot offering this as a wondrous elect for a horror cinematography marathon. Let me propose ""Intruder"" or ""Popcorn"", as those are both pretty decent and will stand the test of time.",0
"I caught this on IFC last week and I thought it was classic of the indie short subject film: heavy on style, small on substance and originality. Does it comes as any surprise that a coming out film stars an unusually attractive (and blond to boot) boy with 70s shag hair and too-cool-for-school clothes? Plus, this film wallows in late 1970s chic, which works for some (Sofia Coppola's ""The Virgin Suicides"" comes to mind) but not for this director.<br /><br />Another reviewer compared this to Harmony Korine's work and I agree. Yet I don't view this as a affirmative thing (what has HE done lately, anyway?). ""Bobbycrush"" is really just a waste of time and energy for all involved. If you happen to see it late night on cable, turn the channel and watch something else instead.",0
"Acolytes presents an interesting blending of original concepts in ""screaming teen"" clich√©s horror with a more thriller-like pacing. During some ways Acolytes is very successful, but in many other ways the film fails miserably.<br /><br />Holistic Acolytes avoided the typical archetypes of the naivety and innocence of youth of endless horror films in the like of Cabin Fever, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and countless other films where unsuspecting and relatively naive and innocent teenagers, have sex, run around screaming and one-by-one are plucked off by some sort of monster. Instead this innocence is replaced with pride, retaliation, and arrogance. The characters had several opportunities to save themselves from immanent death and despair, but failed to do so due to their own personal demons. In the end you were left with the feeling that there were no (and perhaps are no) innocent victims.<br /><br />As the name implies, the film also touches greatly on following a leader or authority. This was used in a direct sense of if the main character would become like the serial killer and was also used less directly throughout the film. Following a central figure is a reoccurring themes throughout the film.<br /><br />Through all this, the film makers also incorporated a lot of clich√©, which I suspect was intentional and gave the film a unique mixture of depth as well as shallowness which I found intriguing. This, perhaps inadvertently, plays well with the nature who are, at frst semblance very superficial but as the fairytales unfolds it become palpable that they are, at fewer the two main men character, perfectly sophisticated.<br /><br />Technically the cinematography has a lot of problems however. The movies, which is normally regarded greatly, I finds somewhat fatuous and over-stylized, utilizes formulaic 2/3 approaching far too rigidly. Many transition I believed were similarly over-stylized. The uses of symbolism was not only ambiguous, but apart considerably over using.<br /><br />The plot was poorly planned and relied exclusively on misinformation in order to achieve a rather hokey twist ending, which was poorly resolved and leaves viewers confused. Methods used to resolve the climax are cheap and ill-prepared, motivations are routinely unclear, and major plot points remain untied in the end.<br /><br />Overall, the film's relative originality, themes and thesis are lost in a maze of poor technical execution, over-stylized imagery, unclear motives, obtuse and unnecessary symbolism and cheap twists maintained only by a lack of or entirely incorrect information.<br /><br />If the film were better executed, it would have been excellent. However, Acolytes receives only two stars in my opinion.",0
"I was totally drilled with this film, melodramatic for no apparent reason. Every thing just becomes so serious and people are swearing with really dumb expressions. Then there is a serial Killer who apparently can Kill one person to get the title of serial Killer. Well the serial Killer likes butterfly and is depicted by sound repercussions you might hear in the dream sequence of most modern films;<br /><br />why oh why? I nave no idea. It really really wants to be fearful, but I think in this universes scary equals speaks a whole bunch and adds dark ambient noises.Just for the recordings, this is in no way is a terror cinematography, its most decidedly a thriller (scarcely). Really movie makers nowadays need to do their homework before making ""abomination"" films or at least calling a movie a ""horror"" film. it makes me say (in too may words ironically) ""acolytes, you take forever to say nothing.""",0
"Art-house monstrosity strive to use unconventional aesthetics to covers the fact that this is just another serial shooter chiller which finally relies on porn combinations of teen sexuality and violent gore. The suburbs come across about as well as they do in every piece of Australian writing (book or film) since 1960 - surprises surprise, the outskirts have a dark underbelly - and the plot is as contrived as any you've seen. ""The neighbours would never know about this guy,"" one of the filmmakers says about Joel Edgerton's character. ""But he was completely plausible as to what he was. Serial killers don't all have patches over their eyes and scars down their cheeks. They look like the guy next door."" Another merchants in porn violence who sees a serial killer in every street. But the authentic insignificance of this film is in the fact that it's a kind film that anyone saw. Backed by substantial funds (including some from Film Finance - that's council), this gets a running at the Metro Film Festivals in Norwich and had to depend on ACMI generosity for a *very* short release season. Q1: What is the FFC doing finances genre flicks, even if they are 'arty' and aesthetically unconventional? Q2: Why are these dirty films (ACOLYTES; BEAUTIFUL; PUNISHMENT; NO THROUGH ROAD) being made in the first place? Richard Wolstencroft & co stimulate their creators to believe they're giving the masses what they really want, as opposed to what the culture elite in governments funding think they want. The truth is that these brutal and forgettable nasties earns far more critical acclaim - and win far more obscure awards - than they're due.",0
"The film inaugurated with a religions leader attempting to resurrect a dead member with his followers chanting for his rebirth as the sun strikes upon them in the desert. Reanhauer(Bill Roy)believes wholeheartedly in his power, and gets so worked up that he collapses with what appeared to be a heart attack. Unable to keep him alive, all those involved, doctors and nurses, are sentenced for attack with Reanhauer's demonic spirit invading the curvaceous body of nurse Sherri(..big-chested Jill Jacobson)targeting each one using her as a tool of vengeance. Forced against her will, with no memory of inflicting such harm, Sherri's host body murders selected victims. Fortunately, Sherri's fellow co-worker, nurse Tara(Marilyn Joi)begins a rather blossoming romance with a blinded patient, Marcus Washington(Prentiss Moulden), once a star football player, whose mother was a practitioner of voodoo. Through Marcus' knowledge, passed down from mom, Tara finds out about possession and how to possibly save Sherri before she murders everyone unknowingly. Meanwhile, Sherri's lover, Dr. Peter Desmond(Geoffrey Land)worries about her present condition and welfare.<br /><br />Well, this was my first Al Adamson flick and I must agree with his detractors that, just from this film alone, it seems he holds them together with paper clips and Elmer's glue. The animation with which we see the spirit take control of Sherri is beyond frightful and rather ridicule. A little soft-core absurd as filler, some viciousness owning tossed in the mix(Sherri actually speaks in another voice when she's possessed), with nasty medic demeanor(..the three nurses focused on in the film all are quite sexually active and free-spirited)and a little bit violence/gora. The film is principally shot in tiny rooms with uninspiring discussions from a rather commonplace casting. The sexual situations aren't that hard-core and Al routinely flushes them without revealing all that much. The film seems crudely inexpensive and there's an absences of thrills, nevertheless the chilling score(..which sounds like something from Dark Shadows)does help a little bit. Jacobson and Mary Kay Pass(..as nurse Beth who seems to be a nymphomaniac if she'll even screw a nutty patient, always complaining of illnesses he really doesn't have, with enough chest hair to declare him a Neanderthal)aren't bad looking, and Adamson's story-line, although frail, is somewhat coherent(..it seems he rarely directs films which are). Overall, the movie looks like it cost 5 bucks and Adamson just can not overcome the budgetary restrictions(..or, in my opinion, create an unpleasant enough atmosphere due to a sometimes plodding narrative and tedious scenes which do little for the story). John F Goff has the role of the hospital's psychiatrist who wants to commit Sherri, not believing the idea that she was possessed;he constantly bickers with Peter over her. I watched the unrated ""lost"" version which I guess is the real version to watch of Nurse Sherri.",0
"I bought this on VHS as ""Terror Hospital"", and when I got home I checked IMDb and was like OMG it's the legendary ""Nurse Sherri""!!! So here's another one from Al Adamson, who had clearly learned some minuscule amount about film-making since the ""Blood of Dracula's Castle"" days. Where that earlier effort is a more or less totally sclerotic lump, this one blend it up a little, adding a definitive facet of diversity and surprise amid the incompetence. Sure half of the movie is a blind post-op football player shooting the breeze with his stacked nurse, but at any moment we might be cutting away to the cackling disembodied head of the satanist mastermind, or Nurse Sherri running a farmer through with a pitchfork, or a wee bit of abstract student-film quick cutting to go with the pulsing-blob effects in the possession scene, or the most gratuitously half-hearted topless bit ever, or god knows what else (I forget, to be honest). As dumb-ass pieces of sh*t go, this one runs toward the highest end. Congrats, Al.",0
"This is a tough film to rates. While it truly deserves its 3 (or perhaps even a two), for an Al Adamson film, it's exceptional--and virtually Adamson's very best. That's because unlike many Adamson films, there are times when NURSE SHERRI almost looks competent. But, being an Adamson film, you know that sooner or later that crappiness OWE rearguard its grisly head! <br /><br />The film begins with some surreal cults ringleader of a huge congregation (six) trying to resurrect a dead guy who looks like he's made of blue cheese. However, in the process, the cults guy has a heart attack and it taken to the hospital. He apparently dies, but it also seems like many of these hospital scenes are missing and a few of them appear much later in the film. In other words, when you see the film, he appears to have possibly recovered--only to hear later that he'd died. Because the guy is the b.f.f. of Lucifer, however, his evil soul can't die and he comes back to both haunt one of his henchmen and to possess Nurse Sherri.<br /><br />Now, Sherri is certainly a very tormented lady--demonic possession or not. At times she acts like a zombie and at others she's violently homicidal. So I enquired...""why didn't her boyfriend (a doctor) think this was, perhaps, problematic?!"". In other words, after trying to kill a patient, he neither gets an exorcist nor commits her to the booby hatch!!! Oh, and speaking of boobies...this cinematography is NOT the breast-filled sex romp its title and placards would indicate. Albeit there are a few bare boobies here and there, they are inconsequential to the plot and only seen very briefly (1/2 second or so) in all but one scene. So, if you are a perv, this movie is not for you--though a few venues in the film (such as the nurse undressing for a patient) make it look like the film MIGHT have, at one time, been designed as a porn flick.<br /><br />If you are a bad movie fan, however, there is enough to whet your appetite. Some examples of incompetence are the inability of many of the actors to deliver lines that aren't zombie-like--and I am not even talking about Sherri. Especially noticeable is one of the very final scenes--I have never seen and heard some stilted acting and dialog in my life--and this includes Ed Wood's films! There are also a few more cheap touches, such as the bad animation of the ""green stuff"", the doctor finding a murdered nurse yet continuing to investigate in a house where walls are covered in blood (I'd get a cop...better yet, an army of cops).<br /><br />So despite these problems, why do I think it's good for an Adamson film? Well, the story isn't all bad and he was able to build tension very well. Many false alarms early on made my heart race a bit. Also, the car crash, while irrelevant, came off pretty well and was practically big-budget for Adamson.<br /><br />Overall, not a good film and one most people would be bored watching. However, fans of Adamson or inept films will like it--it does deliver some entertainment in a cheesy manner that will provide a few laughs.",0
"Maniratnam, who in India, is often compared with prominent world film makers and is regarded a genius in film-making, has yet again proved that he can only make the frames look visually good, without offering much food for thought.Forget about pure cinematic pleasure that can be derived from cinema as a very old form of art.<br /><br />While I would not like to claim and portray myself as someone who has seen all the beautiful movies made around the world, still any thoughtful and a bit educated film goer can identify that his films do not contain innovative ingenuous plots, does not contain lingering effects afterward and MOSTLY contain ridiculous ending and a LOT of melodrama, seen profusely in Indian movies.<br /><br />Overall, Maniratnam has satisfactorily corroborated my repugnance for his films once again.<br /><br />Sorry for those who on this board were claiming otherwise.

"Jacqueline Hyde starts like any other normal day for telemarketing individual Jackie Hyde (co-producer Gabriella Hall) until her boss (Robert Donovan) fires her for taking personal calls at work, however it's not all bad news as the call she took was from a lawyer informing her that her Grandfather (Malcolm Bennett) has recently died & that he left her his mansion & fortune (why doesn't stuff like that ever happen to me? Sigh). Very excited Jackie heads on over there & makes herself right at home, while looking for the thermostat late one night Jackie stumbles upon a secret room where her Grandfather stashes the bright red formula that he invented that allows whoever drinks it to change their appearance. Being a bit on the porky side Jackie finally settles on the glamorous Jacqueline (Blythe Metz), conversely Jackie's better looking alter-ego startup to take supervision...<br /><br />Written, co-produced & directed by Rolfe Kanefsky I thought Jacqueline Hyde was complete total & utter damnit from start to finish & it's as easy & straight forward as that. According to the opening credit Jacqueline Hyde was 'inspired' by the classic Robert Louis Stevenson novel 'The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde', frankly if Mr. Stevenson could see what was being done to his story here he'd turn in his grave. For a start I think Jacqueline Hyde was/is intended to be a terror film, the IMDb certainly lists it as such but there isn't any horror in it at all regardless from just how inclement it is. I would say that Jacqueline Hyde is more a soft-core porno than anything else & tremendously tammy with it, why sit down & watch this warmer than soft porno dammit when you can watch you proper hard-core stuff that actually delivers the goods? Why, that's the question I ask here. It's not even alright pornography either, besides being far too soft it's dull, boring & the not-worth-mentioning sex scenes are few & far between. The most intelligent aspect of this film is the title which would have been quite clever if not for the fact that another film used the Jacqueline Hyde (1998) title during the last century & judging by the IMDb's plot summary it sounds a hell of a lot better than this piece of litter. This is one of those films you have to watch yourself to see just how bad it is but just hope that you never get the opportunity.<br /><br />Director Kanefsky was obviously working on a low budget but that's not an excuse these days, shot on a digital camcorder the film looks cheap & the few instances of CGI look like they came from a Nintendo Gameboy, the final 'shocking' twist has probably the worst morph effect I've ever seen & is pretty good for a laugh as is the scene when Jackie's breasts grow via more terrible CGI. That's another thing, the film takes itself far too seriously. The subject matter sucks, is far too predictable & makes for a poor film but maybe if the dialogue had been intentionally funny with some dirty porn talk the film might have been more fun to watch, alas it isn't so it isn't. Forget about any decent horror, violence or gore as there isn't any apart from a surprisingly bloodless decapitation at the end.<br /><br />Technically Jacqueline Hyde is home made film type stuff, the photography is of the flat hand held point-&-shoot variety, the music, production design & special effects are of a suitably low standard to match the script. The acting was awful, seriously this is bad.<br /><br />Jacqueline Hyde in my opinion a load of crap, there is not one positive thing about this turgid film that I can think of. Any proper film lover will have an almost impossible time trying to find any redeeming value in this crap, definitely one to avoid.",0
"This film seems well made, and more endeavors should be made to promote films by women. That aside, this film is moreover deeply unnerving in that it warrant the manipulative and psycho machinations of a nature that is profoundly troubled. If you've seen any of the promotional material, you might think this is a poignant film about a relationship that's reached its end, but nil of that proposed how really disquieting the central premise is:<br /><br />A woman threatens suicide unless her soon to be ex agrees to relive here most treasured memories of their relationship. When told how unfair (to say the least) that such a threat is, Tessa (the purported protagonist) suggests that ""life's not fair.""<br /><br />Huh??? This character also uses tears to manipulate her former lover into staying, and coaxes him into sexually oriented behavior (which she initially denies as a motive) all the while assuring him ""this isn't sex.""<br /><br />Reverse the genders, have the leads played by Tracey Gold and Brian Austin-Green and this could air in feature length on Lifetime with a title like ""Hostage to Obsession."" There is no medically accepted definition of sound mental and emotional stability that would encompass Tessa's behavior in this film.<br /><br />Props to Kristen Thomson for playing a border-line psychotic, manipulative ex to a T, perhaps too well because there is no well-adjusted person, male or female, who could watch this and not have shivers run up their spine.",0
"It harmed to watch this movie, it genuinely did... I wanted to like it, even going in. Shot obviously for very little cash, I looked past and told myself to appreciate the inspiration. Unluckily, although I did appreciate the film on that level, the acting and edit was terrible, and the last 25-30 minutes were utmost thumb-twiddling territory. A 95 minute film should not drag. The ratings for this one are good so far, but I fear that the friends and family might have had a say in that one. What was with those transitions? Dear Mr. Editor, did you just purchase your first copy of Adobe Premiere and make it your main goal to use all the goofy transitions that come with that silly program? Anyway... some better actors, a little more passion, and some more appealing editing and this makes a dignified movie.",0
"Rita Hayworth is just awesome at times and, for me, the only motif to watch this silly movies. Despite the overdone 1940s lipstick, Rita was one of the all-time glamor women of Hollywood. In fact, for a couple of years I can't imagine anyone that looked better, except maybe Elizabeth Taylor in her prime.<br /><br />Anyway, the co-star of the show, Gene Kelly, does not play his routine likable, at least the kind of guy we all know him from in ""Singin' In The Rain."" Here, Kelly's ""Danny McGuire"" pouts much of the time. Phil Silvers, who I loved on TV at ""Sgt. Bilko,"" is so stupid in here as ""Genius"" you will just cringe listening to his silly jokes....and they are silly.<br /><br />The picture are buena with splendid Technicolor, which almost looks superb. You get to see a lot of pretty women in here, too, not just Hayworth. Regrettably, the histories isn't all that much. It centre about Hayworth deciding about a career choice. Along the way, we get the normal shabby treat of marriage and we get an insultingly-dumb terminated. All in all, an unmemorable movie, except as a illustrate for Hayworth's beauty.",0
"Like 'Singin' in the Rain', 'Cover Girl' has a trio of two guys and a girl. In 'Cover Girl', Phil Silvers (Genius) is the comic relief. He corresponds to Donald O'Connor's funny man part in 'Singin in the Rain'. In Cover Girl, Gene Kelly's love interest is Rita Hayworth and in 'Rain', it's Debbie Reynolds. That's where the compares ends.<br /><br />Whilst ""Singin' in the Rain' is a conventional American movie musical, 'Cover Girl' is mediocrity incarnate. The story isn't very sprawling. Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) is a dancer in Danny MacGuire's low-rent cabaret in Brooklyn. Rusty decides to enter a Cover Girl contest sponsored by a wealthy publisher, John Coudair, who made an unsuccessful play for Rusty's grandmother years ago. Coudair introduces Rusty to Broadway producer Noel Wheaton who makes her into a star. Danny feels slighted when Rusty starts showing up late for rehearsals at the nightclub and decides to close the club down and go on the road entertaining the troops along with his sidekick, Genius. At the last minute, with Rusty at the altar with Noel, she realizes the error of her ways and runs back to Danny. They live cheerfully ever after.<br /><br />Gene Kelly has the slightest worded party in the cinema. All we find out about him is that he owns a nightclub and is incredibly in likes with Rusty. Coudair and Wheaton act like besotted adolescent about Rusty and Phil Silvers gives some thoroughly goofy but unfunny shtick. The most interesting aspect of Rita Hayworth's performance is the scene in which she gets drunk. This foreshadows what happened to her in real life. Anyone who has read her biography will learn that she disliked Hollywood, pined away for a normal home life which she could never reach but eventually began drinking and ended up with full-blown Alzheimer's during the last years of her life.<br /><br />Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful. Gene Kelly has only one really excellent dance number and that's the scene where he dances with his 'alter ego'. Earlier, the trio has another number which is a pale precursor of 'Make em Laugh' from 'Singin' in the Rain'.<br /><br />The most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal. A couple of decades later, Raquel Welch had the same problem. Both actresses later in their careers would always try and find scripts that showcased their acting abilities. They wanted to be known as 'actresses' and not 'pinup girls'. Unfortunately, 'Cover Girl' is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.",0
"Rita Hayworth plays a Brooklyn nightclub dancer named Rusty who specializes in cheesecake chorus revues; she manages to get herself on the cover of a national manner magazine, but her impending success as a solo (with romantic offers all around) has smitten boss Gene Kelly chomping at the bit. Tremendously mangy slice of Technicolor cotton chocolate, with unmemorable musical sketches (the two worst of which are negligible flashbacks to the 1890s, with Hayworth portraying her own grandmother). Kelly, as always, dances well but acts with false sincerity; when he's serious, he's insufferable, and the rest of the time he's flying on adrenaline. The hyphen is a lead weight, not even giving supporting players Phil Silvers and Eve Arden any good lines. *1/2 from ****",0
"Formulaic slasher movies, only this one stars three ten year olds (all born during a lunar eclipse) as the killers. Nice, haah? A little bit of gore and a nice nude scene may deliver this worthwhile for diehard fans of the genre, alia beware.<br /><br />*1/2 out of ****",0
"'Bloody Birthday' is an odd and, at times, humorous low-budget horror flick along the lines of 'Mikey' or a less intelligent version of 'The Good Son'.<br /><br />Set in a small Californian town, three babies are born at the height of an eclipse, where planetary alignment means they are somehow born without emotions. Ten years later, our three little psychopaths take themselves on a killing spree, doing away with parents, siblings, teachers and anyone else who irritates them. Only one teenage girl knows the truth to be able to stop them. There is no explanation for why babies across the world born at the same time aren't equally as twisted but there you go!<br /><br />For a slasher film, it's very tame in terms of violence and gore, which I suppose highlights the problem of casting child characters as the killers as there is only so much you can expose the young actors to. Instead, it's amusing and a little disturbing seeing three ten-year-olds plotting murders and carrying out their plans using guns, knives and crossbows. The main reason why it doesn't descend into being totally ridiculous is because the child actors are very compelling in their roles with the way they slyly play the little innocents in front of undiscerning adults while showing their dark side to the girl who knows the truth.<br /><br />'Bloody Birthday' is rather mediocre as a horror flick, with few scares and little blood, but because it has the shock factor of having kids as the killers, it is a bit unique in that way. One to watch if there's nothing else on.",0
"When you make a film with a killer-kids premise, there are two effective ways to approach it; you can either make it as realistic as possible, creating believable characters and situations, or you can make it as fun as possible by playing it for laughs (something which the makers of ""Silent Night, Deadly Night"" did, for example, on an equally controversial subject: a killer Santa). The people who made ""Bloody Birthday"", however, do neither of those things; they simply rely on the shock value of the image of a kid with a gun (or a knife, or a noose, or an arrow) in his/her hand. The conclusions is both onslaught and nonsensical. The whole film looks like a bad idea that was rushed through production (and then kept from release for several years). It's redeemed a tiny bit by good performances from the kids, but it's SUPREMELY sloppily accomplished. (*1/2)",0
"Murderous Anniversary is a perfectly litter slasher flick from beginning to ending. <br /><br />I found the acting to be pretty good consider the genre of movie and its obvious low budget. I don't know what was going on with the cinematography but it looked ghastly. Way too over-saturated. Maybe this is a bad transference to DVD or maybe it always looked like that, I don't know. <br /><br />There really are no redeeming qualifications to speak of. There are a few dies but not really gory. I wouldn't bother with it if I was you. The finest stuff about the DVDS was the 15 minute interrogation with grower Max Rosenberg who was very fun and honest. He didn't have anything good to say about director Ed Hunt and admits the movie was a failure, but he would like to re-make it as he believes it has a decent plot. However, he died in 2004 so I guess it will be up to someone else to take on that challenge. With the way things have been gonna in the last few years it wouldn't surprise me, there's at least one re-make per week at the film these day. It couldn't be any worst than the original I suppose but I couldn't care less whether it got re-made or not.",0
"A meaning spirited, outrageous horror film about 3 murderous children. Susan Strasberg is totally wasted in a 5-minute cameo, even though she receives star billing. If your a Julie Brown fan, you'll want to check it out, since she's naked in a couple of shots. All others,avoid.",0
"Bloody Birthday opens to a shot of Meadowvale General Hospital. There three babies are being born at precisely the same time during a total eclipse. A caption informs us that it is now 'Meadowvale, California June 1, 1980'. Two teenage lovers, Duke Benson (Ben Marley) and Annie Smith (Erica Hope) are getting down to business in an open grave. They hear noises and Duke investigates. Both Duke and Annie are murdered. Sheriff Jim Brody (Bert Kramer) is baffled and only has the handle of a child's skipping rope that Annie was holding, as a clue. Unfortunately before Sheriff Brody can solve the case his youngest daughter Debbie (Elizabeth Hoy) and two of her friends Curtis Taylor (Billy Jayne as Billy Jacoby) and Steven Seton (Andy Freeman) murder him. Just as they are finishing Sheriff Brody off another young boy from their class named Timmy Russel (K.C. Martel) revolves up, the three assassins are unaware of how much he saw. Soon after the incident Timmy plays with Steven and Curtis in a junkyard. Curtis locks Timmy into an old locker. Timmy manages to escape and tell his sister Joyce (Lori Lethin), but she doesn't believe him at first. The three children carry on their murder spree. Their strict teacher Miss Davis (Susan Strasberg) a lovemaking couple (John Avery and Sylvia Wright) in a van and Debbie's older sister Beverly (Julie Brown) are among their victims. Joyce begins to have her suspicions about Debbie, Curtis and Steven which makes her and Timmy a target for the evil trio. Will they be able to convince the authorities that these three innocent looking 10 year olds are really soulless killers?<br /><br />Co-written and directed by Ed Hunt I have an intense hatred for this film. I reckon it's abundantly frightful and doesn't have a single congenial element to it's 83 minute running time. The script by Hunt and Barry Pearson gives us no explanation for the child killers motives beyond the solar eclipse that blocks out Saturn and therefore for some bizarre astrological reason these three children don't have any conscience, so these are the only children ever born during a total eclipse? If that is true why do they wait until just before their tenth birthday's before starting their killing spree? I guesses it just unexpectedly kicks in, right? To it's credit it is sensibly well paced but I still unearthed it remarkably boring and tedious to sit through. The film as a whole is very unexciting and predictable, the children are revealed as the killers within the first 10 minutes and as I've mentioned next to no motive is given. It's very silly at times, too. Check out the scene where Debbie stops Steven by throwing a bowl of water over him! The Sheriff's death is put down to him falling down some steps, yeah right the injuries suffered from that type of accident aren't going to be the same as if your beaten to death with a baseball bat like he was in reality, any competent Doctor or Pathologist would have spotted that within 5 seconds. There isn't a single drop of blood spilt in the entire film and all of the lame killings are dull and unimaginative. There is some out-of-place looking nudity as Debbie charges 25c to let boys peek through a hole while her sister Beverly strips. There is an early scene just after the 5 minute mark when Joyce walks from the kitchen to the living room and the boom mike is clearly visible at the top of the screen, not even a little bit of it the whole damn thing. The general incompetence continues throughout the film. The whole production is bland and instantly forgettable. The acting is poor throughout, those three kids are very annoying and got on my nerves right from the start and made sitting through this film even more of a chore, especially Curtis in his geeky over-sized glasses. I just hate this film really, simple as that. I can't think of a single good thing to say about it. Definitely one to avoid.",0
"Some may go for a kino like this but I most admittedly did not. A college professor, David Norwell, suddenly gets a yen for adoption. He pretty much takes the first child offered, a bad choice named Adam. As it turns out Adam doesn't have both oars in the water which, almost immediately, causes untold highlighting and turbulence for Dr. Norwell. This sob story drolly accomplished out with one difficulty after another, all centre around Adam's inabilities and seizures. Why Norwell wanted to complicate his life with an unknown factor like an adoptive child was never explained. Along the way the good doctor managed to attract a wifey to share in all the brothel the little one was dishing out. Personally, I think both of them were one beer short of a sixpack. Bypassing this yawner.",0
"Blake Eduard try very hard to change Julie Andrews image in this film. He tried to make her sexy not realizing she already was. I think they were both still a bit irked that Julie had not been chosen to film her Broadway success of Camelot and was passed over as not being sexy enough. Sadly, they opting this car to try and assuage this faith. It attains to the point where it is virtually hilarious witnessing Rock Hudson, who we all know now was gay, kissing Julie every 2 minutes throughout this movie. It seems now that they were not only trying to make you believe that Julie was a femme fatale but that Rock was straight. Tragically, they have completely no chemicals together and the unending hug scenes launched grossing one out. The other mistaken they made with this picture was not knowing what kind of movie they were making. It is almost three separate movies. There is the drama of Julie as the German spy trying to get military secrets from Rock. There is an air war movie with lots of footage of WWI vintage planes swooping about and there is the foolish attempts at mood that Blake Edwards seems to think he has to insert in every one of his pictures whether it is appropriate or not, In this case, it was not. The only honestly redeeming qualities in this film are looking at the always lovely Dame Julie and hearing her sing in that crystal clear bell-like soprano. Of course if you love her, you may overlook the drawbacks of this film just because of her. You can always tell yourself, afterward, that it was a hell of a lot better than sitting through STAR!",0
"Julie Andrews satirically prods her own goody-two-shoes image in this overproduced musical comedy-drama, but if she approaches her role with aplomb, she's alone in doing so. Blake Edwards' film about a woman who is both music-hall entertainer and German spy during WWI doesn't know what tone to aim for, and Rock Hudson has the thankless task of playing romantic second-fiddle. Musicals had grown out of favor by 1970, and elephantine productions like ""Star!"" and this film truthfully tinted Andrews' repute, leaving a lot of dead space in her catalogue until ""The Tamarind Seed"" came along. I've always thought Julie Andrews would've made a great villain or shady lady; her strong voice could really command attention, and she hits some low notes that can either be imposing or seductive. Husband/director Edwards seems to realize this, but neither he nor Julie can work up much energy within this scenario. Screenwriter William Peter Blatty isn't a good partner for Edwards, and neither man has his heart in this material. Beatty's script provides Andrews just one wondrous sequence--a striptease. *1/2 from ****",0
"Years ago, when DARLING LILI played on TV, it was always the pan and scan version, which I hated and decided to wait and see the film in its proper widescreen format. So when I saw an inexpensive DVD of this Jolly Andrews/Blake Eduard opposite, I decided to purchase and watch it once and for all.<br /><br />Guy, what a frightful movie. It's so amiss and on so various levels that I really do not know where to start in describing where and when it goes so terribly inaccurate. Looking at it now, it's obvious to any fans of movies that Blake Edwards created this star car for his wife simply because so many other directors had struck gold with Andrews in musicals (MARY POPPINS, SOUND OF MUSIC, THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE, etc) but also because Andrews was snubbed from starring in projects made famous on stage by Julie herself (CAMELOT, MY FAIR LADY, etc) because Hollywood thought she wasn't sexy or glamorous enough. So Blake generated this stillborn endeavour, to showcase his wife in a surreal concoction of spy story/war movie/romance/slapstick humour/musical. DARLING LILI undergo from diverse dignitaries, never knowing who or what it is. Some peculiar scenes are buena or efficient but as a whole, it just doesn't work at all to a point of it being very embarrassing.<br /><br />Mind you, the version on the DVD is the ""director's cut"", or in this case, ""let's rescue whatever we can"" from this infamous shoebox office fiasco. In releasing the DVD, Edouard cut 19 scenes (19!!!!!!!!) from the original bloated theatrical version into this more simplified and yet surprisingly ineffectual version. The film moves along with no idea of what it is. We are 25 mins into it and we still don't know what's going on or why we're watching what's going. What kind of espionage is Lilli? How powerful is she? Was she ever answerable for someone's death? Instead we watch a meticulously bored looking Rock Hudson trying to woo a thoroughly bored looking Julie Andrew. Things aren't helped much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love. Why does Julie fall for Hudson? Why him and not other men she got involved with? There should have been one of her ex hanging around, trying to win her back or trying to decipher her secret. This would have given us some much needed contrast to the muddled action. It would also have given us some impetuous to the sluggish proceedings. There's no catalyst in this story.<br /><br />One only has to look at the cut scenes to clearly see that Edwards and the writer just came up with ideas inspired by Andrews' (and Edwards') previous successes. The best (or worst) example is the scene when Andrews and Hudson follows a group of children who sing in the middle of a forest. Edwards channeling SOUND OF MUSIC. It's no wonder he removed it from the DVD. Back in 1970, that scene might have worked on a certain level but today, that moment reeks of desperation. There are other plot elements directly inspired by Andrews/Edwards other films. The endless scenes of dogfights is inspired by the much better MODERN MILLIE. The musical moment ""I'll give you three guesses"" was created just to make fun of Julie's MARY POPPINS persona, which is turned ""raunchy"" with Julie doing a striptease in the act. The ending, bird's eye view of Julie running towards Hudson's plane, is another ""wink"" at SOUND OF MUSIC.<br /><br />The whole thing is confusing. Julie plays a singer, born from a German father and British mother, who lives in England but sings her (English) songs in Paris. You never know exactly where the story takes place. Some moments are just badly edited. Like when Julie and her ""uncle"" are on horseback. They talk and talk and then Julie suddenly sprints off in mid-sentence. I'm like ""what happened here?""<br /><br />The comedy bits are unfunny and cringe-worthy. Every scene with the French police are pathetic. Where's Peter Sellers when you really need him. The action is stupid beyond belief. When Julie and her ""uncle"" are on their way to Germany on that train, Hudson's squadron shoots rounds of bullets at the train, almost killing Lili in the process. Brilliant. What's also funny about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but Hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning. That's one slow moving train there. <br /><br />The musical moments. The beginning is the best part of the entire film (and the reason I gave this film 3 stars) but it's effect is diminished considerably because it's repeated at the end. Speaking of redundant, did we really need to see a can-can dance, Crepe Suzette stripping scene and Julie stripping too? The ""Girl in no man's land"" is OK even if it's bleeding obvious, but that moment just doesn't make any sense whatsoever because Lili sings it to a group of injured soldiers at a French hospital, making me wonder: how many soldiers there were injured indirectly by the result of her spying?<br /><br />The whole project is listless and without energy. The romance is 100% unbelievable. Rock Hudson is way too old and tired looking (check out the museum scene). Julie looks dazed, like she's on Valium. But what really kills this ill-conceived project is Julie playing a German spy. Edwards desperately wanted to dispel the Mary Poppins syndrome afflicting his wife and believed that playing a traitor was a good career decision. As much as I like Julie, she's no Greta Garbo, who pulled it off so beautifully in MATA HARI. Funny enough, even if Julie plays a German spy, she still comes across as cloying and cute.<br /><br />How bad is DARLING LILI? Even after 37 years since its release, Blake Edwards felt he still needed to work on it for its DVD release.",0
"David Bryce's comments nearby are exceptionally well written and informative as almost say everything I feel about DARLING LILI. This massive musical is so peculiar and over blown, over produced and must have caused ruptures at Paramount in 1970. It cost 22 million dollars! That is simply irresponsible. DARLING LILI must have been greenlit from a board meeting that said ""hey we got that Pink Panther guy and that Sound Of Music gal... lets get this too"" and handed over a blank cheque. The result is a hybrid of GIGI, ZEPPELIN, HALF A SIXPENCE, some MGM 40s song and dance numbers of a style (daisies and boaters!) so hopelessly old fashioned as to be like musical porridge, and MATA HARI dramatics. The production is colossal, lush, breathtaking to view, but the rest: the ridiculous romance, Julie looking befuddled, Hudson already dead, the mistimed comedy, and the astoundingly boring songs deaden this spectacular film into being irritating. LILI is like a twee 1940s mega musical with some vulgar bits to spice it up. STAR! released the year before sadly crashed and now is being finally enjoyed for the excellent film is genuinely is... and Andrews looks sublime, mature, especially in the last half hour......but LILI is POPPINS and DOLLY frilly and I believe really killed off the mega musical binge of the 60s..... and made Andrews look like Poppins again... which I believe was not Edwards intention. Paramount must have collectively fainted when they saw this: and with another $20 million festering in CATCH 22, and $12 million in ON A CLEAR DAY and $25 million in PAINT YOUR WAGON....they had a financial abyss of CLEOPATRA proportions with $77 million tied into 4 films with very uncertain futures. Maybe they should have asked seer Daisy Gamble from ON A CLEAR DAY ......LILI was very popular on immediate first release in Australia and ran in 70mm cinemas for months but it failed once out in the subs and the sticks and only ever surfaced after that on one night stands with ON A CLEAR DAY as a Sunday night double. Thank god Paramount had their simple $1million (yes, ONE MILLION DOLLAR) film LOVE STORY and that $4 million dollar gangster pic THE GODFATHER also ready to recover all the $77 million in just the next two years....for just $5m.... incredible!",0
"I'm not a big fan of musicals, although this technically might not qualify as a musical. But I thought I would give it a chance as I love war movies. It was mediocre at optimum.<br /><br />Hudson seems totally out of kilter in this role. It just didn't jobs for me. Jolie Andrew probably played her part as best as she could, but I just find it hard to buy her as a conniving, deceptive spy. Sorry, I know that is classic stereotyping on my part. But I have to say I think this is Julie at her most wondrous and feminine looking. I always thought of her as more matronly, but then surely that's a result of her roles in Sound of Music and Mary Poppins. No doubt they were desperately trying to get her out of that typecasting in this role. She was quite beguiling in appearance here, but I still didn't buy her as a spy.<br /><br />I couldn't keep my focus through the whole movie and discovered myself adjusting in and out - and having conversation with those in my room (which I usually never do - I'm always shushing everybody). So that tells you how tiny it held my attention. Don't waste your time!",0
"A tough sale: British playwright Ronald Harwood adapts his autobiographical stage drama into loud, bellowing film about WWII Shakespearean theatrical troupe saddled with an aged, blustery, brilliant-but-unreliable star at the end of his tether. The actor's effete assistant works diligently to get his master coiffed and costumed for a production of ""King Lear"" (during an Air Raid!), yet both men are losing their grip on their unraveling situation. Based on the waning years of actor Donald Wolfit, whose dresser was Ronald Harwood, this hailed production would seem to be a welcome haven for scenery-chewing thespians. Unhappily, Albert Finney (at this point in his career, not at all elderly) seems too robust and quick-thinking to play the actor; Finney (and Oscar-nominated director Peter Yates) cannot modulate Sir's moods and bouts of coherency in a way that makes sense to us, so that in one scene he's stopping a train with the commanding echo of his voice, and in the next he's curiously falling apart. With such a wreck of a human being in the midst of failing health and aptitude, one would assume a dedicated assistant would go to great lengths to protect his boss (and his future), yet servant Tom Courtenay prods and badgers and goads Finney to carry on rather than rest. Courtenay, who played this part on stage (and was nominated for an Oscar alongside Finney for Best Actor), is far more attuned to his role, and eventually his bleating commands and disarray reach the only real feeling in the film. These two, fortunately, do not peck at each other's heads, and scenarist Harwood is careful not to fall into a love-hate pattern (which could possibly be perceived in the film's first act); but, without a juxtaposition of servant vs. celebrity, there's nothing much to behold in this portrait except for the worsening of narcissism, the hint at what once was. *1/2 from ****",0
"I wish I knew what to make of a movie like this. It seems to be divided into two parts -- action sequences and personal dramas ashore. It follows Ashton Kutsher through survival swimmer school, guided by Master Chief Kevin Costner, then to Alaska where a couple of spectacular rescues take place, the last resulting in death.<br /><br />I must say that the scenes on the beach struck me as so stereotypical in so many ways that they should be barnacle encrusted. A typical bar room fight between Navy guys and Coast Guardsmen (""puddle pirates""). The experienced old timer Costner who is, as an elderly bar tender tells him, ""married to the Coast Guard."" The older chief who ""keeps trying to prove to himself that he's still nineteen."" The neglected ex wife ashore to whom Kostner pays a farewell visit. The seemingly sadistic demands placed on the swimmers by the instructors, all in pursuit of a loftier goal. The gifted young man hobbled by a troubled past.<br /><br />The problem is that we've seen it all before. If it's Kevin Costner here, it's Clint Eastwood or John Wayne or Lou Gosset Jr. or Vigo Mortenson or Robert DeNiro elsewhere. And the climactic scene has elements drawn shamelessly from ""The Perfect Storm"" and ""Dead Calm."" Nil of it is fresh and none of the old stereotyped characters and situations are handled with any originality.<br /><br />It collaborate best as a kind of documentation of what goes on in the swimmer's school and what could happen afterward and even that's a little tenuous because we don't get much in the way of instruction. It's mostly personal conflict, romance, and tension about washing out.<br /><br />It's a shame because the U. S. Coast Guard is rather a noble outfit, its official mission being ""the safety of lives and property at sea."" In war time it is transferred to the Navy Department and serves in combat roles. In World War II, the Coast Guard even managed to have a Medal of Honor winner in its ranks.<br /><br />But, again, we don't learn much about that. We don't really learn much about anything. The film devolves into a succession of visual exhibitions and not too much else. A disappointment.",0
"Alas, another Costner movie that was an hour too long. Believable performances, but the script had no where to go and was in no rashness to get there. First we are offered an unconnected string of events few of which further the story. Will the hyphen center on Randall and his wife? Randall and Fischer? How about Fischer and Thomas? In the end, no real front story ever develops and the characters themselves are artificially propped up by monologues from third parties. The singer explains Randall, Randall explains Fischer, on and on. Finally, long after you don't care anymore, you will learn something about the script meetings. Three endings were no doubt proffered and no one could make a decision. The end result? All three were used, one, after another, after another. If you can hang in past the 100th yawn, you'll be able to pick them out. Albeit the transparent attempt to gain points with a pledge to the Coast Guard, this one should have cleansed out the very first day.",0
"It seems ever since 1982, about every two or three years we get a movie that claims to be ""The Next Officer and a Monsieur."" There has yet to be one movie that has lived up to this claims and this movie is no multiple.<br /><br />We get the usual buzzed off scenes from OAAG (""I want you DOR,"" the instructor gives the Richard Gere character his overdose of drills in hopes he'll quit, the Gere character comes back for the girl, the Gere character realises the instructor is great, etc.) and this cinematography is as predictable as the sun rising in the Southeast and is awfully miscast on superior. Costner plays his habitual ""wise teacher"" personage, the only character he can play, and you really get a sense of his limited acting proficiency here. Kutcher is horrible in the Richard Gere character, just miscast with acting skills barely a notch above Keanu Reeves.<br /><br />The main difficulties with this OAAG wannabe is the two main characters are so unbelievably one-dimensional, you never care for either in the least and when Kutcher's character finally turns around (just like Gere did in OAAG) you just go ""so what? The movie departs no intrigue point unturned and seems to never end as if to say ""oh wait, we forgot to close out the girlfriend story, or the what happens after he graduates story, or the other six plot points in the movie..."" What's more baffling is the wondrous ""reviewing"" I see here. The general public's opinions never cease to amaze me.",0
"This is a pale imitation of 'Officer and a Gentleman.' There is NO chemicals between Kutcher and the unknown woman who plays his love interest. The dialogues is wooden, the circumstances hackneyed. It's too lang and the climax is anti-climactic(!). I love the USCG, its men and women are fearless and hard. The action scenes are splendid, but this movie doesn't do much for recruited, I fear. The script is formulaic, but confusing. Kutcher's character is trying to redeem himself for an accident that wasn't his fault? Costner's is raging against the dying of the light, but why? His 'conflict' with his wife is about as deep as a mud puddle. I noticed this sneak preview for free and definitely deemed I got my money's worth.",0
"I`m in two spirits about FOLLOWING , the film infancy of Christopher Nolan . Part of me admires it for costing 6,000 dollars to make but part of me dislikes it for being too art houses . In many ways it remembered me of the cult movie PI , a film I disliked , and I can`t get my head around the central plot of a man who wants to be writer following people around . Wouldn`t it be more logical for someone wanting to be a writer to sit in front of a keyboard and write ? <br /><br />Oh well I reckon FOLLOWING provides indie film strategists expectancy that just because they made a no budget movie costing $6,000 over two thousand IMDB members will vote for it and over five hundred members will comment on it , but you have to wonder if this movie would be so well regarded if it wasn`t made by the director of MEMENTO ?",0
"This movie should have been billed as three movie-summaries linked together to form a full-length feature film (including lots of shots of people slowly walking down dark corridors and streets). BE WARNED! The first hour of this movie is straightforward a re-hash of the first two Aztec movies as told by the main character. The actual movie doesn't start until the thing is almost over. I must say, the overacting on the part of the Bat is quite fun.<br /><br />As for the robot, I thought a robot was a mechanical device that may or may not resemble a human. The Bat's ""robot"" consists of a radioactive reanimated corpse encased in a lead robot-body. As Tom Servo put it, ""He's not that impressive; he doesn't even have knees!"" That, and it takes the robot about an hour just to lumber across the room. But once he catches you, WATCH OUT! He'll disintegrate you with a touch (powered by radium? Pluh-ease!).<br /><br />This is a magnificent film when accompanied by Joel and the Bots. Alternately, you're just a glutton for abuse.",0
"I am a big fan of bad horrors, cheap horrors, b movies, and all that bottom 100 movies, and I do not deny those are the worst stuff ever to enter the big screen, or even your home video for that matter. Some of them, e.g. the infamous Manos The Hands of Fate, are truly bad, and watching them, especially on your own without any friends and beer around, is a torture for a good cinema taste. <br /><br />La Momia Azteca Contra El Roboto Humano, however, was not that bad. Well, of course it's BAD - it's silly, dated, corny, cheap, etc., there's an Aztec mummy, a tin robot, a fat masked villain, a mad scientist, Mexican mobsters, etc. the montage is poor, the lines, well, let's say the lines are not theatrical, the FX and SFX are the best what the Mexican low budget production could've offered, etc. etc. Still, the movie is FUN. it's so mala it makes you laugh cheerfully for an hour time. Sure it depends on one's sense of humor, however I'm pretty sure La Momia should teach any newcomers to this kind of cinema how to enjoy it. Please note: the movie lasts for about an hour, and I think it's just enough time of silliness one is able to easily digest. <br /><br />There's also another thing - watching La Momia can give you a clue what was the whole SF/Horror genre concept back in the fifties, when you compare it to the present day Matrix era of cinema entertainment. I think it also shows how both the industry and the audience evolved, due to the fact the watches like La Momia still attract full house in the theaters for some special shows (movies like this are special alright), and very often receive a standing ovation.",0
"Ah, such an initial title for a very inferior film. The dubbing is funny since the voices and mouths never seem to match. As a result, I had no idea what was going on as I observed this chaos unfold. There are recollections within the flashbacks and no real time takes place until towards the very end. The Aztec rites had me laughs. I rewinded it twice and gets the nicest alta workout ever. The singing Aztec lady is comic naturale and the dancing and attire are a hoot. Some guy gets a face full of acid, there's a lot of fighting, you have no idea who any character is (not that I really cared), and it's a whole negro chaos. Oh, and the actual fight doesn't happen for awhile, so during the movie feel free to get up, take a nap, take a trip. You won't miss anything exciting.",0
"The first 2/3 of this film wasn't that dissimilar to the American momma films of the 30s and 40s. Two lovers in ancient Mexico dared to defy the law and were doomed to die. One became an Aztec mummy whose job it was to guard the sacred treasure and his lady love. And the lady was reincarnated in the present day and the mummy was naturally attracted to her. So far, it's all the characteristic mommy film...though it's quite a bit slow and duller than the American versions. Oh, and of course the Aztec mother seemed really, really crappy.<br /><br />However, into this standards but boring film there is a super-villain. Why? I dunno--it sure didn't make any sense to have one. It seems this villain wants the treasure and he manages to hypnotize the lady and have her show them where the Aztec treasure is buried. Why does he need the treasure? Well, to buy the equipment needed to make an army of atomic robots, dummy! But first he has to construct a single mummy to defeat the mummy, as the momma has so far been unstoppable.<br /><br />You've did to see these ""human-robots"" as they look like the enormous clunky robots from Flash Gordon and other series BUT they have a rubber head of a supposed dead guy inside! They really look hilariously funny and seeing the conclusion when there is a huge battle between the lethargic mummy and the equally slow robot is worth seated through the stays of the boring movies. Both combat in super-slow-motion like they are bathed in taffy... and it's accomplished in such an artless and nonsensical fashion that it is bound to elicit chuckles--certainly not thrills.<br /><br />Overall, the film is dreadfully boring and a muddled mess--especially at the end. Yet, for naughty movie lovers, it's a must-see--it's wicked but unintentionally comical and wondrous to watch and laughter at with homeys.",0
"**SPOILERS** The third and joyfully last of the Aztec Mummy trilogy in the fact that the series major star-besides the Mummy- actor Ramon Gay, as Dr. Eduardo Almada, was gunned down by the outraged husband of a woman he was having an affair with on May 28, 1960! Still that didn't stop Gay, in him being edited into them from his previous films, from being in a number of future Mexican horror movies made over the next four years after his death.<br /><br />In ""Robot vs the Aztec Mummy"" we have the once again mad scientist Dr. Krupp trying to get his hands on the Mummy's golden breastplate and bracelet in order, by having them deciphered, to find the Aztez treasure that's been secretly buried somewhere in modern Mexico City over 500 years ago. ""Robot vs the Aztec Mummy"" is not much as a movie in itself in that its made up of stock footage of the previous Aztec Mummy films that take up over half of the films running time.<br /><br />After getting introduced to the movie's cast members, some who have been killed in the previous Aztec Mummy films, we get down to the authentic nitty gritty in it involving the evil as well as criminally insane Dr. Krupp also know as ""The Bat"". Dr. Krupp-who looks like a wild eyed and crazed Orson Wells-is a man with boundless visions of grandeur in him not only uncovering the long lost Aztec treasure but now, unlike in the two previous movies he was in, creating life and using it in making an army of human robots to take over the world. An idea he must have gotten from watching Ed Wood's 1955 ""Atomic Superman"" classic ""Bride of the Monster"".<br /><br />Unable to handle the Mummy in his two other encounters with it, where he ended up getting thrown by it into a snake pit filled with deadly rattlers, Dr. Krupp had created a robot, with a human cadaver stuffed in it, to the job, of doing in the Mummy, for him. With he Mummy sleeping in its tomb at a local Mexico City cemetery Dr. Krupp has his Robot-Man brake into the Mummy's crypt to do battle with it and destroy it with its bolts of deadly radiation. <br /><br />***SPOILERS*** The big built-up to the Aztec Mummy Robot-Man confrontation turns to be a big let-down with the Mummy having no trouble at all dispatching the ""Tin-Man"" in less then 30 seconds together with its creator Dr. Krupp. All this while both Dr. Almada and his friend and assistant Pinacate, who came to the Mummy's aid, have nothing at all to do but sit back and watch the action. Now without the mad and off-the-wall Dr. Krupp annoying it the Mummy can go back to its eternal resting place without ever worrying about the problems of the modern world at large, like Dr. Krupp, that it has really no interest in.",0
"Oh, man, they sure knew how to make them back then. Hollywood has forgotten the basic ingredients of bad movie making: cardboard steel and the god fearing scientist action hero! <br /><br />This film was so close to a masterpiece, alas it was not to be, as it failed to feature ray guns and invaders from the Moon. The MST3K version tried to fix this by adding a pilot of a show called Captain Cody, where a guy with a rocket propelled jacket fights bad make-up people from the Moon, but it didn't quite add up.<br /><br />Also, the comments of the guys in the theater were not nearly as funny as I expected them to be. All in all, a wondrous disillusionment.",0
"Like a lot of movies involving little kids, this starts off ""real cute"" and likable...and then, after about a half hour or so, becomes the versa.<br /><br />That's certainly the case here in this time-travel story (which I popularly love) where an adult meets a kid who his really him at the age of eight! Wondrous supposition and a great lead actor in Bruce Willis, but.....<br /><br />The kid ""Rusty"" is a smart-aleck and whiny brat and Willis Rusty grown up now as ""Russell"" gets abrasive with his constant yells. That is entertainment? Nos, thanks.<br /><br />Young Breslin has gone on to become a very good child actor, being involved in a number of films including ""The Cat In The Hat"" opposite a more famous child actor: Dakota Fanning. <br /><br />Entire, a disappointing cinematography, especially with all the good press this movie got when it was released.",0
"First of all, I wasn't sure who this film was geared at - it seemed like a story for kids but had stuff in it kids wouldn't understand and find bore. There wasn't really much to it, Bros Willis wasn't stretched as an actor at all. He did a lot of glancing to the side with that half smile of his - unless you are a big fan of his I wouldn't bother. And if it's the story you're interested in (guy who seems to have it all but is lacking emotionally is taught lessons from a child), I would go to see About A Boy. It has everything this film lacked, comedy, sadness and reality.",0
"The Children was born retarded. It pulls in a half-dozen guidelines, hallmarks dialog and measures lifting from much older and better-known flops, and might be hilarious -- if only the writers knew what funny is.<br /><br />Disney stuff has gotten a lot better in the last couple of decades, but don't let that fool you. They should have given The Kid a wide berth, sang it a dodo, then ran the train into a ravine. Mercy homicide.",0
"I can't highlighting it enough, do *NOT* get this movie for the kids.<br /><br />For that matter, you'd best spare the adults from it as well.<br /><br />All right, perhaps I'm overexaggerating a little. This isn't the meanest kids' flick... no, let me rephrase that. This isn't the hardest cinematography made by dissilusioned grownups DURING dissilusioned grownups and somehow marketplace towards kids (that would be ""Jack"", which I've been meaning to review / gut like a fish).<br /><br />Adults won't learn nothing unbelievable (well, if you must, fast-forward to just before the end credits for a Educational Bit about an Interesting Cosmic Phenominon). We don't usually end up doing as adults what we wanted to do as kids as reality tends to get in the way. Well, duh, I could have told you that (so can four years of college at an art school, but I degress).<br /><br />I have no thoughts what the heck kids could possibly get out of this movie. Most likely it will only upset them (we get to watch the moment when Russ was traumatized at eight years old). There's a better movie, ""Kiki's Delivery Service"", that has essentially the same messages but handle it litely instead of drilling it into your head. And the grownup will loves it too!<br /><br />By the way, there is a moment in the movie made with amature MST3K-ers in mind, if they think of that OTHER Bruce Willis movie with a sad little kid in it.",0
"Bros Willis, as ordinary, does an wondrous job.<br /><br />warning: may be considered a ""spoiler""<br /><br />While my friend thought it was good, I kept glancing at my watch during the entire movie wondering when it would end. After seeing such great flicks as ""The Patriot"" and ""Chicken Run"" I was truthfully frustrating in Disney's ""The Kid.""<br /><br />Willis plays a middle-aged man with a harsh and realistic attitude on putting a positive spin on people's images (he's an Image Consultant). An unknown kid shows up. Yes, it's him but younger, and even Lily Tomlin can seeing him. At this point I'm recalls of a cross between a poorest ""Quantum Leap"" episode and a inclement time travelling flick.<br /><br />Kid and Willis go through trying to figure out why he's in that time period. They figure it out. They meet Willis when he's older. Nevermind that it never goes into detail how old Willis teleports them between time periods and gets them together to begin with, how he got that knowledge to begin with, how he came to the realization that he needed to do this, and so on.<br /><br />Mostly, it's a very knackered, unoriginal, uninspiring plot that has some great actors in it. The good news is that ""the Kid"" actor is nowhere near as annoying as he's presented in the trailers on television.",0
"There are a few scripts like this one floating around Hollywood; this one is not even close to the best--just the first. This is all productivity value, no substances, but the Disney name probably will help it. A alright brainchild, a wasted luck.",0
"I saw this only because my 10-yr-old was bored. He and his friend hated it but of course liked being at the movies. This is the first time I've strongly differed with Ebert in many years. There is not a single thing to recommendations this film. Willis is good, as always. But the story sucks, is fabulous, there is no real story, no action, no interesting cinematic sequences, no surprises, and worst of all, the kid superstar is A rigorously hateful slug guaranteeing to turn off any parent who does not have a dweeby fat slob for a kid. By all means stay away and spare your child - unless you want to punish him or her. There is no apologies for such squalid instructing or writing and one hopes these cinematographers will suffer accordingly.",0
"After reading Fool For Love in a Drama class of mine, I was looking forward to seeing how Sam Shepard's wonderful play would be translated to the screen. Much to my discouragement, it was anywhere near as entertaining as the play. The film seemed to drag, the music was inappropriate for the tone of the movie, and all the raw energies of the play seemed to have been aspired out of this film version. It's a embarrass to see this arriving out this camino even with Shepard's involvement, playing the role of Eddie. Do yourselves a favor...see the play next time it's being performed in your area or simply read the book instead.",0
"At the heart of almost every truly excellent crime thriller is a carefully considered, methodically planned-out high stakes super-crime, which 9 times out of 10 is committed by a bunch of likable, grey-scale morality underdogs for who life isn't fair, for whom getting back at the man is, well, something worth cheering for. First-time screenwriter James V. Simpson's script for Armored gets this half right. He made extra-double-sure that we've got nothing but sympathy for the recently orphaned, Iraq war veteran Ty Hackett (Stomp the Yard's Columbus Short), who's about to have his house taken away by an evil bank (brother, I've been there). And he gave Ty a good family friend in Mike (Matt Dillon) who is super nice and gets him a job at the armored car company that he works at with Baines (Lawrence Fishbourne) and some weird French dude (Jean Reno). These guys like to have fun and play pranks, but they are also serious armored car guys too, so that means they carry guns and are tough.<br /><br />After a short while, as one theoretically watches Armored, one might start to think as I did, that maybe - just maybe - this is going to be some kind of awesome, tongue-in-cheek, cornball heist movie with some on-the-nose characterizations that move the story along its natural course, cranking up the personal stakes of all involved in hopes of unveiling a really, really clever plan with lots of potential 'holy sh*t' moments. I mean, the music alone is textbook heist-movie - gritty, edgy beats working overtime as we're treated to close-ups of characters who say things like ""As a matter of fact I do,"" and ""Are you crazy??"" For 45 minutes or so, the movie had some serious genre-flick potential.<br /><br />Then things start to really odour. These dudes, these idiots, have no plan. There's no ""Ok, here's what we're gonna do..."" scene, no blueprints, no explosives, no black van or ski-masks (despite their 'test-run', as can be seen in a trailer). No, these guys are going to steal $42 million dollars from their own trucks (which are only being tracked by HOURLY contact over the radio, despite being equipped with some fancy, big-deal 'GPS technology'), and they aren't even going to sit down and discuss it. Hell, Mike only tells Ty about the plan the night before, which is completely ridiculous. But of course, Ty's got his house to think about so as long as Mike promises that 'no one will get hurt,' he's on board. Guess what, though. Somebody gets hurt. Why? Because, besides driving the trucks into an abandoned factory to hide the money, they have no plan. That was it. That was how far they thought things out. So, naturally, things start to unravel. These cats deserve everything they get for being so unprepared.<br /><br />This script, frankly, feels like it's like the product of some bad improv game: ""Armored Car, robbed by its own guards...GO!"" Despite some half-decent buildup that could have maybe taken the film in a few interesting directions, the story just completely falls apart, and pretty soon, NOTHING makes sense, or is even remotely plausible.<br /><br />When filmmakers don't have a cool ""hook"" for their heist, their characters seem stupid, and bungling. And when characters are stupid, and bungling, it's hard for an audience to invest in them, and their story. And when that happens, any suspense drains out the bottom of the movie, leaving a laughable, hollow husk.<br /><br />Skip it. 3/10",0
"I went to see this movie today, with waits that it would involve an at least half-intelligent fairytales. I was terribly frustrating, as it did not. The plot, and the decisions by the main character, were so far-fetched. I was expecting for a ""Dog Day Afternoon""-type movie, but instead got something totally intolerable. I actually found myself totally hoping for the ""hero"" to be knocked off, and I nearly walked out of the theater on several occasions when this should have happened but didn't. Heist movies are notmeant to be feel-good flicks, and this one strived to be just that. Every couple of minutes during the second half of the movie, I found myself saying, ""no way"". Without giving the whole story away, it revolved around an armoured car guard who was financially down and out, and whose house was going into foreclosure. He was invited in on a heist, and accepted, only to back down once the action began. Fragile.",0
"There is not much to add to what others have already commented, the movie fail hard where it shouldn't, it has no depth in the planning of the heist and the characters are so startling.<br /><br />One thing that got me thinking, was that although the rest of the gang is trying hard to remove the pins from the doors of an armored truck, because there is supposed to be no other way of opening it, the guy inside the truck, with great ease manages to remove the floor of the truck which happens to have a hole in it so he can get out, and then get back in, without being noticed by anyone, because no one else could think that he could get out from there or even better, that they could have gotten into from there.<br /><br />Promising but not quite there.",0
"Unbelievably frustrated. The rhythm was slow. The characters phenomenal and in the film as a whole just let me feel boring and unfulfilled. There was no real plot that could keep you revolving around the film and keep you interested. The heist itself never offered any elation and didn't seem very well though through.<br /><br />There was not enough depth or background to any character and Laurance Fishbourne's character was one I eagerly awaited for, unfortunately Laurance has no idea how to play the thuggish brut and is much preferred as a likable character. Columbus short one of my favourite protagonists (in stomp the yard) allowing me down with his performance, his trait was dark and you could almost see what drove his reasoning.<br /><br />The only nature I think offered anything to the film was Milo Ventimiglia (Pedro Petrelli in Heroic). Though his character quite small and insignificant I think his touching adds to an all around uninspiring film.<br /><br />In Conclusion buy the DVDS if you want to find a new way to waste your time.",0
"How do you take a cast of experienced, well-known actors, and put together such a silly movie? Nimrod Antel has the answer: Armored. Six co-workers at an armored car business decide to steal a large shipment of cash themselves. But, just as they get to first base with their plans, everything unravels speedily. With a plot like this, you'd think it couldn't be too bad, at least for an action movie. However, in the first 40 minutes or more of this movie we see what appear to be 6 normal, everyday kind of guys. They joke, they laugh, have a few drinks together, etc. Then, we suddenly learn they're planning to rob their own business. The hero Ty, (Columbus Short), is sucked into the scheme because of the cold, cruel world, even though he's a decorated veteran, nice guy, and reliable employee. Oh my, oh my! Then in the last 40 minutes of the film, these former regular guys nearly all turn into money-crazed psychos, willing to butcher each other for cash. In the last scenes Mike, (Matt Dillon), goes on a suicidal rampage for no other reason than to kill his former friend. The viewer has no hint before this ending that these men are this relentless and bloodthirsty. It's utterly unbelievable and ""B movie"" is almost too kind for this sort of cheesy plot. I would say don't waste your time--too bad no one gave Laurence Fishburne, Jean Reno or Fred Ward the same advice before making this picture.",0
"A new guard in in the armored truck gig is recruited by his co-workers to steal 42 million from the truck. No bad guys, so no one will get hurt, right? Of course things go wrong and the new guard decides to have a conscience and make things right by saving the life of a dying man.<br /><br />I'll admit that I didn't really have any interest in this film, but I didn't have any interest in Fantastic Mr Fox either, and that film made my top ten of the year. Armored is even more of a displeasure then I thought it would be. As a heist film, it fails to deliver the goods, it's bore and full of plot holes and leaps in logic that one will hurt themselves thinking about it.<br /><br />Despite this the film someplace has a really wondrous cast, but the cinematography doesn't yet employs this to it's advantage. Someone seem wasted in wooden attribute that make foolish chooses. Columbus Short is an uninteresting lead that is never charismatic and never makes the spectators want to give a crap. Matt Dillon is the mastermind behind the heist and he plays Mr. Nice Guy at first, then when things don't go his way he quickly becomes the villain. The rest of the remarkable cast include Laurence Fisburn, Jean Reynaud, Skeet Ulrich, Fred Ward, Amaury Nolasco from Prison Break and Milo Ventimiglia from Heros. Non of them do much and when they actually do something, it's without much reasoning behind it.<br /><br />The film is relatively short, but even with it's running time under 90 minutes, it believed dragged out. How longer can you make a film about a guy trapped somewhere? Phonebooth did a dignified labour and it was even more restrained. The leaps of logic concerning the plot here are tragic. 42 million and all the security they have are check ins every hour or so? The entire plan from my understanding was to drive the trucks into an abandoned warehouse and hide the money. Pretend to get hit and burn the trucks. They would then walk away with the money. Of course something goes wrong, or there would be no movie right? Through a series of unhappy events out so drew hero has trapped himself inside the truck with an injured officer. The stays of the movie is Dillion and his crew pounding on the gates to get in. How very intriguing.<br /><br />The script calls for our hero to have financial problems, he might lose his house, which would in turn make him lose his brother. You see, both their parents died and it's just the two of them looking out for each other. So now he has a reason to join the heist. At first he didn't want in, but his money problems is just the right push to throw him in the thick of things. How convenient. <br /><br />Armored's whole spin on the heist genre is that it's from an armored truck, from the guys who drive it. After that basic premise, the film falls flat on it's face. I found myself wanting it to end sooner and sooner each time someone spoke. Speaking of the ending, it sucks. <br /><br />Skip it.",0
"OK I for one thought the trailer was quite good so was hopeful for this film, plus with the cast line up I was sure it couldn't get less than a 6 in my books. However I got indignant half hour into the narratives... just where normal films get good, this film hit rocks bottom. <br /><br />SPOILER * The guy who everyone is trying to help is so caring of other people getting hurt in the middle of the hustle that he turns on his colleagues to save a tramp and then locks himself inside one of the armoured trucks. Not only that, he constantly tries to get other peoples attention by which he ends up endangering more people and long story short, the outcome is that he is responsible for not just the tramps death, but also a police officer getting shot and the kidnapping of his younger brother... oh and all 5 of his colleagues dying disgraced deaths. <br /><br />But in the end he is HAPPY because he came to his senses halfway through the tries, so what if all his colleagues are now dead rather than sticking to the plan and being a millionaire. This film strived to be so politically rightness it makes me sick! Devastated a good tale. Embarrass really.",0
"One of those cinematography in which there are no big spins whatsoever and you can predict pretty much whats is going to happen. Matt dillon was wondrous once again, but the resting didn't played a bigger part as they should have.<br /><br />It was exciting in the beginning but kinda slow paced and predictable in the end.Its one of those flicks in which the good guy wins no matter happens.If you have absolutely nothing to do, you can give it a try I personally detected it not worth staring. The story could have been more interesting and the director could have made it less of a B-movie by engineering a happy ending.",0
"What a bad movie, the premise was all there, the actors were all there. And yet a believable intrigue, good dialogue, characters to relate to were somewhat missing.<br /><br />Typical heist gone wrong premise set against a backdrop of everyman being shafted by the system. The lead character Tye and his little brother have been having no luck and their house is going to be repossessed, along comes godfather Matt Dillon (Who does not look much older than Tye so not exactly sure how that happened)to the rescue with a plan to steal money from an armoured van which they work on as security guards. Tye has a brief flirtation with a conscience but decides to go along with it. And thus begins a truly terrifying hole ridden 30 minutes of awesome dustbin. I will not list all the ways in which this movie was unrealistic but let me point out the major ones:<br /><br />Because of Tye deciding to be a good guy because a homeless guy became collateral damage, all of his close friends including his godfather die. His godfather who is supposedly family and the man who brought him into the caper at the last minute to help him out dies because of Tye. Tye in the process of thwarting his friends and godfather destroys all the money. The money came from the same bank that was repossessing his house. And yet he chose it over the supposed family of Matt Dillon.<br /><br />There are many more, needless to say that this film was tripe and I earnestly hope nobody else goes to see it.",0
"This looks so good on paper - Matt Damon, Lawrence Fishbourne, Jean Reno, nice right? And a heist with $42 million - sounds like a kick-ass crime movie.<br /><br />Big dissatisfaction - I reckon the stars got all the money because the production values on this are lousy.<br /><br />But more than that it the pseudo reservoir Dogs atmosphere when the easy crime goes wrong. It's very much made for TV stuff.<br /><br />All in all highly discouraging - it score points for being what it is - but losing them massively for being, bluntly, not very interesting at all...",0
"When a friend once lambasted me for my first movie (a pretty bad videotaped affair), I argued that I could grow; Orson Welles' first movie, indeed, was even worse. He challenged me that it couldn't be, so I pulled out the Criterion laserdisc of (I think) CITIZEN KANE and played HEARTS OF AGE. My friend lasted just a few minutes before conceding the point.<br /><br />There is a kiddo humor in this short, but it's predominantly as cocky as (and perhaps a collegiate answer to) BLOOD OF A POET and other avant garde films of the time. It is what it is: a inheritance of images with a fuzzy theme, and if you really enjoy any footage of Welles (in heavy makeup, to boot), this isn't really even worth tracing down.",0
"I was a hippie age 22 in 1965, have seen the play 5 times, have 2 versions of the music, and have read the script many times. Maybe taken as an separate thing, the movie is OK, but as an approving of the play, it's horrendous.<br /><br />First the good. The songs are sung well, and the production valuing are pretty good. The homosexual implications in Black Boys, White Boys is cute. The Claude/Berger switch was interesting. Hair is a fluid production, and constant changes in it are inherent provided the basic spirit of it is retained.<br /><br />But the basic spirit was very much warped. It seemed like all the manufacturers wanted was to sing certain songs, and fit the story-line to them regardless of what that did to the original intent of the play.<br /><br />Claude, Sheila, and Hud were presented as a selfish brats who could care less about anyone outside their tribe. Claude destroyed Sheila's parents party (it's hard to believe that she smiled while her parents were being hurt), and repeatedly stole cars. Sheila stole the soldier's clothes and car. Then she left him in the middle of the desert where he would certainly sunburn badly, probably be busted in rank, and could likely die on that lonely Nevada road. Good fun. And Hud found it fine to break his son's heart while yelling at his ex. This is not what hippies were like, not what the play described, and is directly opposite to a love generation.<br /><br />I've never seen a hippie beg for money. The point was to be self-sufficient outside the capitalist system, not beg from it.<br /><br />After Berger is thrown in jail for ruining Sheila's party and Claude offers to bail some out, Birger insists on being bailed instead, with no better plan for bailing the rest that hitting on Sheila's parents, and then hitting on his own mommy.<br /><br />""Be In"" has always been a very spiritual point, but here it is wasted on silly brides floating around. Even if this is part of his trip, it ruins a splendid song. I know they're contrasting ""Floating In Space"" with the Army. But again, it totally rubble a beautiful song.<br /><br />While Sheila and Claude are skinny dipping, Berger steals their clothes, laughing ""it was fun man"" even after he could see both were very annoyed. Then a little later, Berger does one thing that no hippie ever does. He hits Claude. Terrible.<br /><br />Then they have the perfect opportunity to sing ""Starshine"" at night in some beautiful SF spot with the stars twinkling down, maybe working into an inventive duet. Instead, the whole tribe sings it in the blazing sun speeding down the road in a convertible (stolen of course).<br /><br />I was vastly disappointed with the movie in 1979, and I like it even less now. I think it would have been possible to do a reasonably close adoption of the show, but this ain't it.",0
"I should start off by saying I have something of a love-hate relationship with musicals. Some of them are fantastic, some are downright crap. So I expected Hair to fall into one of those categories. However, it didn't, falling instead in the middle.<br /><br />The songs aren't wondrous, though the ""Sodomy"" song did make me smile a lot, and everything is rather dated looking. But the movie didn't draw me in as others have, such as Rocky Horror. Although that's a bad example, since for years I hated Rocky Horror, then all of a sudden I got it and have loved it ever since. Maybe Hair will be the same. Although I doubt it will get as much exposure as Rocky Horror due to the language and nudity content, so I doubt I will get the chance to have it grow on me. Gettit? Hair....grow...oh suit yourself.<br /><br />Anyhow, I didn't get to see the last fifteen minutes or so due to a technical glitch, which was a shame, since I would have liked to see how it ended, especially after reading some of the reviews here.<br /><br />Not a film for the casual cinema-goer, but definitely one for musical lovers. I really hope they don't re-make it, though, since I think any such re-make would end up a shallow, pale, PC version of the original.<br /><br />Worth a look for lovers of the genre.",0
"I never heard of this film when it first came out. It needs have poured quickly. :o) I saw it on cable while sick in hospital so I hardly had enough energy to watch it, let alone turn the channel. Best choice than the Style Channel. ;0(. Filmed on location, this travelogue should have been on the Travel Channel. The plot is recycled from ship board farces of the thirties and forties. The cast seems to have been recycled from the fifties. Donald O'Connor, star of musicals and Edward Mulhare as a card shark. As to the main cast, Walter Matthau is still playing the same part as he did in Guys and Dolls or was it the one about the orphan girl? Wiseacre irresponsible gambler and rounder. But it just doesn't taking with a man of his age. As to Jack Lemmon, he plays his part so straight, he can hardly dip and glide when danse. And as mentioned, Dyan Cannon is outstandingly seductive as another swindler sailing with her mother who thinks Walter is rich, while he thinks she is rich. Elaine Stritch plays Dyan's mother, another retread from the fifties. The most fun is the running feud between Brent Spiner as the domineering and snotty cruise director who immediately spots Walter as a poor dancer, and spends his time trying to get him dismissed so he will have to pay for his free passage. In the end, though he receives his comeuppances. Meanwhile Jack mopes about, meets an attractive woman, with mutual attraction, but their affair is broken up by Walter's lies that Jack is a doctor, when he was actually a retired department store buyer. But finally, the two men take to the sea in a rubber boat to intercept her seaplane and all is well. There does not seem to be any principal player under the age of fifty.",0
"Let's not delude ourselves, okay? We all know that this film was made because of the success of the ""Grumpy Old Men"" movies. Unlike those, still, this comedy has nought mood and very little crux.<br /><br />Luster DeHaven is the unique shining light to be watched. It breaks my heart that she was finally given the chance to show off her skills to a new generation of moviegoers, only to end up in a slice of dreck such as this. There was a touching scene which featured her being stood up by someone she was falling in love with. Her fine performance was the only quality acting going on in ""Out To Sea"". Everyone else is just going through the petitions. 2/10",0
"In 1904 Tangier, a wealthy American woman and her two children are kidnapped by Berbers, murderous desert pirates who scorn the Moroccan government and, by doing so, kidnap ""American pestilence"", which attracts the attention of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt. Fictitious historical epic is less a grand adventure than it is a special, rather exhaustive throwback to the desert-sheik films of the 1940s (with a bit of ""The King and I"" interjected, besides). Portraying the cloaked, mustachioed, bloodthirsty leader and his snippy, haughty captive, Sean Connery and Candice Bergen could be acting in two entirely different movies (neither one seems to know how far to carry the camp-elements of their characters and dialogue, and both seem singularly without proper directions). The various (and anonymous) slashings and beheadings which occur are arbitrary: we don't know any of these victims, and the big action scenes become blurry, loud montages of sand-swept violence on horseback. The pluses: a much-lauded music score by Jerry Goldsmith (Oscar-nominated, but a loser to John Williams' ""Jaws""), fine location shooting and movies. *1/2 from ****",0
"Luscious Candace Bergen as a prim Victorian beauty, kidnapped by Sean Connery as a devilish desert Sheikh! How can you go wrong? How? Oh, let me count the ways!!! Earthy, primitive Sean Connery, exactly the right man to tame a brittle, classy beauty like Candace, is . . . well, underwhelming in the role. That's because, instead of having dialog about the real issues (""you are a woman . . . I am a man!"") he has to bla senseless about ""the will of Allah"" and ""the wind blows destiny across the desert sands."" John Milius, a superintendent known more for the worship of naked male bodies and brute military force than any insight (or interest) in conventional human relationships, has a galling way of cutting away from his desert lovers every time it looks like Candace might get kissed. Instead of staring nature take its course with two fabulously seductive people in a colourful landscape, we are processed to infinite, (and I do mean ENDLESS) shots of Brian Keith flashing his walrus sized choppers and provide gritty sermons on the joys of being Teddy Roosevelt. I have nothing against Teddy Roosevelt, but staring him test out his new rifle or make speeches about the heroic death of a big bear just doesn't excite me the way the love story between Candace Bergen and Sean Connery would have . . . if it had ever actually gotten underway! The weird thing is, Milius spend most of his time building up nature and story lines that have no resolutions. Candace's two little children in the narratives both obtain more screen moment than she does. There's no mood, no chemical, no sizzle, in any of the things that happen to her in the desert. Unless you think it's comical that after weeks of galloping around on horseback her hair is still perfect.<br /><br />The only ""real"" moment in the story is when, late at night, Candace Bergen shakes her little daughter out of a sound sleep on soft cushions and says, ""we must escape."" The little girl turns over and, without missing a beat, replies, ""but mother, I was sleeping!"" That one line monies up what's really missing from the story. No menaces, suspense, or sizzle in the basic story line, of a cultivated lady in internment. She (and her enfant) are both so snug and well adored for that it's hard to believe anyone is worked up about their fate.<br /><br />Mind you, if Candace herself had said the line it might have worked better. If the tension came from her enjoyment of her captivity, (or her delight at being in the arms of Sean Connery) and her guilt about all the trouble being caused by her abduction, then the story would have had some tension. But Milius makes the odd assumption that the audience is just as worked up as he is over whether Teddy Roosevelt will get the chance to prove his manhood three thousand miles away. In the end the pretty lady and her children don't seem to matter worth a damn to him . . . and since they're at the center of the story the whole thing seems rather dry and endless . . . like the burning desert sands.",0
"This movie is not at all like City of God, you might get the same feeling but it isn't, there's no intensive shooting nor intensive medicines scenes, you get the idea. If you ask me I believing this film was a squander of time, there are a lot of other films which gives 100 times better meaning and teaching than ""Wood Camera"". Yes I might be the only one to give a negative comment for this film but it's only in my opinion. It's one of those films where I can get the feeling that I'll be blown away but when the credits start to role my friends and I all gave mutual looks, and we all laughed at how foolish this movie was. So to conclude this matter, I advises not to watch it.<br /><br />Personally observes - Making Africans speaking Francais was a gros mistaken. In City of God they used their native language which gave the film much more power and realism.",0
"He who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster. And if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.<br /><br />Yes, this is from Nietzsche's Aphorism 146 from ""Beyond Good and Evil"". And that's what you find at the start of this movie.<br /><br />If you watch the whole films, you will doubt if it was the message that the Ram Gopal Varma Productivity wanted to pass on. As the scenes crop up one by one, quite fierce and at times puke-raking, the viewer is expected to forget the Nietzsche quote and think otherwise. That to deal with few people you need dedicated people like Sadhu Agashe who will have the licence to kill anyone, not just writing FIRs (something unworthy of the police to do, as we are made to believe).<br /><br />When TADA was repealed and the government wanted to pass newer and even more draconian laws, RGV's ""Satya"" did the required brain surgery without blood transfusion for the multiplex growing thinking urban crowd whose views matters in a democratic country like India. Within a year MCOCA was passed.<br /><br />When real life encounter specialist Daya Nayak 'became a monster on the path of fighting them' and was himself booked by MCOCA, ""Aab tak Chhappan"" was made to heed out ""false"" impression among the people about this. With it's ""you have to be a monster to save your nation"" approach.<br /><br />And people consumed it. Nos issues raised. Only commend and hopes that they get a Sadhu Agashe in their local police station who will solve all problems and hence let only milk and butter flow all over. Blood? You can ignore.<br /><br />Every time Israel attacks Palestine or Beirut, we hear voices like ""India must also similarly attack Pakistan"". This cinematography is accomplished for such sociopaths. If you don't give them this, they will probably die out of boredom and LSD and what not.<br /><br />Thereby this game of the passion of hatred.",0
"An interesting schedules picec shows us what was surprising in 1938. Gosh, Ma, a fake accident ring suing for $25,000!!! I guess projected into the 21st century it would amount to a lot of money. The acting would amount to pure 21st century ham. Nice to see the chairs as a hard-working newcomer.",0
"This film appears to be an expos√© of the current trend towards globalization and homogenization in the wine industry. Wineries around the world are more and more either joining large conglomerates (the American producer, Mondavi, in the case of this film) or paying high-priced experts to help them make ""the perfect wine""--and as a result, wines are becoming very standard and predictable. To some, this is a good thing (especially since few can afford to pay $50 or more for an everyday wine) and to others this is frightful as the uniqueness of smaller wineries is disappearing. I truly can realise the worries of both sides and don't think there is a hoodlum or hero in this business. Sure, good and cheaper wine is a nice thing, but like what's happened with beers (with giants like Unibrew and Anheiser-Busch), food (McDonalds), shopping (European shopping malls are almost indistinguishable from American ones) and mega-stores (like Walmart/Asda) are taking away much of the uniqueness of ""the little guys"". So I clearly was ready and willing to listen to these film makers. Conversely, with a product that is almost two and a half hours long AND a general lack of focus, the film exclusively came too big a chore to watch and I outof interest. An 80-90 minute focused film could have been MUCH more effective--especially since the average viewer is NOT an oenophile (that's the high-brow word for a ""wine aficionado"").<br /><br />On the very positive side, the film makers are smart not to do much talking at all--and simply allowing those on both sides of the issue do the talking. Plus, the themes is so relevant and opportune. Still, while choosing a good style of documentary making, the film exclusively goes on way, way, way too long and finalized up doing a very uninspiring cinematography.",0
"i was looking forward to this, and to be honest there were some bright spots, but it would have worked better if it had concentrated on one story rather than shooting all over the world. The many dogs were a lot of fun but i get drilled of the winemaking fascists pompously whining (;-)) on about their achievements.<br /><br />I felt it would have worked better as an hour long TV documentary, focuses on one of the many different issues it explores. The most interesting being the french town near montpelier fighting off a an American wine company's campaign to get rid of the historic forests. A socialist mayor agreed to a deal, a nicely timed election arrived, and a communist mayor was elected, who turned it down, much to the exasperation of the American wine execs...<br /><br />hopefully the director's cut will be shorter than the original..",0
"As pointed in other comments here, the camera-work is laughably faulty. I am tempted to say that the director of photographer is a 7-year-old, but that would be mean -- to 7-year-olds.<br /><br />Okay, but what about the subject? I was looking for some insight into the state of the wines industry worldwide, you know, Mondovino. What the movie is about is a very restrained view of one intrigue in that world: the combats between Mondavi and the French and Ltalian wineries that they would like to buy. There is no enlightening narration that would put the whole deal into context, so we are left with the picky process of the director and the conversations with the various characteristics in this small psychodrama. There's no shortage of despicable characters, or even despicable dogs, in sight. There is a rarity of evenhandedness, however. <br /><br />Is the director a Marxist? I asked as I tried to maintain some semblance of focus as the camera slid, swerved, zoomed in a chaotic flourishing. Small grower in France: good. Huge grower in USA: very, very mala. Forget about the hundreds of small wineries throughout North America, Australia, and South America. There is a dead horse to beat here for over two hours.<br /><br />To learn about the intrigue more, you are better off reading about it elsewhere. And you will be able to sample your favorite wine without feeling sick while doing so.<br /><br />I suggest a new award at Cannes for Best America-bashing Diatribe.",0
"Oh God! It could be a very interesting film and in fact it is. I would have like to give it a 5 but i give a 2 for my vote. Why? I saw it in a theatre! See this film on DVD or on TV! The shootings is really really POOR!!!!! It keeps shake all the time, in a completely tasteless formulating!<br /><br />Its really painful to see this very interesting film in a cinema. You got quickly seasick and you have to make some huge effort not to puke on your neighbor 's seat! <br /><br />It's really a shame 'cos, the story is edited in a non-linear way which is quite rare (and a very good idea!) for a documentary. <br /><br />Watch this at home!",0
"There were so many classic movies that were made where the leading people were out-and- out liars and yet they are made to look good. I never bought into that stuff. The ""screwball comedies"" were full of that stuff and so were a lot of the Fred Astaire films.<br /><br />Here, Barbara Stanwyck plays a famous ""country"" magazine writer who has been lying to the public for years, and feels she has to keep lying to keep her persona (and her job). She even lies to a guy about getting married, another topic that was always trivialized in conventional films.<br /><br />She's a New York City woman who pretends she's a great cook and someone who knows how to handle babies, etc. Obviously she knows nothing and the resides piling up so swiftly you lose tracks. I guess all of that is suspected to be hilarious because lessons are learned in the end and true love prevails, etc. etc. Please pass the barf bag.<br /><br />Most of this cinematography is NOT comical. Stanwyck was far better in the film noir kind. As for Dennis Morgan, well, pass the bag again.",0
"An weird, willfully skewed biopic of Dyan Thomas in which we hear little more than a dozen lines of his poetry. Instead we have to endure a raw character expos√©e seen through the prism of his proto-bigamous relationship with wife (Sienna Miller) and childhood love (Keira Knightley). Matthew Rhys plays Thomas with sufficient charm to inoculate us against his otherwise repellent self-interest and Cillian Murphy makes up the persistently taut lovetet.<br /><br />The film never seems to decide on where it's going. There's no arc so much as a viaduct from one end of the war to the other. Maybury seems much more interested in his two female leads (who wouldn't!?) than in the man who brings them together and then divides them. Miller is the choice of the two (I found Knightley competent at best but then I have never found her sympathetic) but they both offer terrifyingly inconsistent Welsh accents. Other funny decisions include too much for the inconsequential character of William (Murphy), arty production (eg double crossfades) that is neither impressionist nor symbolic and the old chestnut act of period footage which doesn't blend. 4/10",0
"After I saw this I concluded that it was most likely a chick flick; afterward I found out that Keira's mother wrote the screenplay so that pretty much confirmed it. However, a chick flick can have some appeal to men; this one does not and really seems not to appeal that well either to women (looking at the dismal box office receipts). One item that I believe both genders agree upon is the stupidity of the the scene, in the movie, whereby an analogy is made between the pain of childbirth to the pain of a limb being amputated w/o anesthesia. Though men do not undergo the pain of childbirth we understand that it is a painful process; yet it is a natural pain whereas an amputation certainly is not! Women understand this even better. I suspect some woman was trying to make a feminist statement that is in poor taste. In fact, a lot of things in this movie are in very poor taste. Though movies nowadays are known for having poor taste this one really ""excels"" in that department. This could have been a good movie that shows the struggles of Dylan Thomas during WWII; and how strong the sentiment was against men who somehow managed to avoid serving in the military then. Keira's screen writing mother tries to show how this sentiment was used against Dylan but really muddles this. Instead we get a chick flick about how two young mothers bond together; sort of. In a way. Perhaps. Somehow. Of note is the fact that a soldier (the husband of the friend of Dylan's wife) is sent back home after serving in combat; yet it is unclear if the war has ended!! A lot of things about this movie are similarly unclear; and though I have stated that already I will do so again as it seems to be the central motif of this muddle.",0
"My god...i have not seen such an frightening movie in a long...long time...saw it last night and wanted to leave after 20 minutes...keira knightley strives really really hard in this one, but she thats handled it..declined her accent every once in a while and didn't have the charisma to fill the role...sienna millers acting gets you to a point where you start to ask yourself: Has she ever had acting lessons? judging by the edge of amore shes never been to acting class, but should consider to go in the near future...they both look really pretty..maybe thats what they should focus on in their future career..if they can be actresses everybody can!",0
"The (DVDS)movie ""The Tempest"", directed by Jacques Bender, was published in 2001. It didn't make its way to German cinemas and neither the director or an actor were able to receive an important award for this movie. The movie refers to the Shakespearean play ""The Tempest"" which was published at the end of the 16th century. The director attempted to create an modern version of this play, but faulted. At the beginning of the movie the plantation owner Prosper gets in a conflict with his brother Antonio about the treatment of their slaves. Antonio sets his brother a trip and tries to kill him but with the help of a witch, Prosper is able to escape and flees with his daughter and a slave called Ariel to a small island nearby the Mississippi river. For over twelve years he has lived isolated on this island, till a lucky chance enables him to take revenge on his brother....If Prosper will be lucky you have to find out by yourself.<br /><br />In my opinions this cinematography is truthfully a negative attempt to creations a contemporary version of the original play by William Shakespeare. The tales of the movie is bewildering as well as the characters. Prosper doesn't have the same powers as in the storm..... CEASES OF PARTE I",0
"Frankie Muniz plays Jason who is a high school student. His biggest problem is his life is built on small or big lies that puts him into trouble most times. However, he cannot escape from his teacher and he finishes his creative writing homework just before its deadline. While he is biking fast to hand his homework to the teacher, he crushes into a car. As he explains the situation to grumpy man(Giamatti) in the car, he gives him a lift to his school. But the problem is Jason leaves his homework in the car, the other way of saying this is Marty Wolf(Giamatti) steals it.<br /><br />After a few months Jason goes to a movie and sees a trailer that takes him aback. Because the story of the movie is based on his homework. He tells that to his parents but of course they don't believe him. Especially his father uses words which insults him. Jason decides to go to LA and find Wolf to tell his father that Jason is not a liar. When Wolf refuses it, Jason takes action and ruins his life.<br /><br />This is the short story of the Big Fat Liar. Well, as a kids movie it might be a light hearted one but there are some errors that even could would ask if that is possible. Such as, having such a small amount of money and going to LA with a friend to sort the problem out, having access to this cinema producer's highly protected house and office, setting up a telecommunications system overnight.Does it seem believable? It does not. Well this is a kids movie but kids are not that gullible.<br /><br />Big Fat Liar gives some little glee to its target audience. Sadly, I am not a big fat liar to say that this is a good movie. ** out of *****",0
"Not near as well made as the ""Guinea Pig"" flicks it was inspired by (""Flowers of Flesh and Blood"" or ""Devil's Experiment"") and not conveying any real ethos, this video feature, which is barely feature length, adds hardcore sexuality (with mosaic censoring) to its inspiration. The peculiar make-up influencing, which include stomach slitting and disembowelment, are quite good, if overlit. The enthusiast feel of the production is a distraction. It all seems inexpensive and lazy. The light is harsh and the sound and editing are sloppy. The simple story involves a porno actress who ends up starring in a real snuff movie. Just when she gets tired of being abused, the real abuse begins. In the film's hero scene, an actor cuts the woman's stomach open in graphic close-up, stuffs his member inside it, and proceeds to do his thing. I didn't find ""Psycho - The Snuff Reels"" shocking. On the contrary, I found it to be a desperate attempt by lovers to one-up ""Guinea Pig"" and its bloody ilk. Interestingly, this was distributed by Aroma, a leading fetish producer.",0
"just watched this ""film"" and it genuinely made me want to write my first comment on IMDb.com, even though i've been a user for more than 9 years. the reason that i watched this, is because i like splatter films and sometimes i like to test my limits and see what actually still convulsions me. first of all, the gora in this film didn't shocked me, not even the idea that someone came up with this and made it into a film - what really astonished me, is that there seems to be a marketplace for this genre of baloney. don't get me wrong - i'm all against censorship, but this film seems to me like it was made for some kind of fetish plethora that seem to obtain off on this genre of sh*t.it didn't give you that same kind of repulsion and guilt that one felt after watching films like ""august underground"". that films is spooky to watch, but at least you get the feeling that the filmmakers want to show you how hateful violence is. in the case of ""niku daruma"", it seems like it was made tightly to arouse people. i prefer films that shocked, because they are well done and thought through, like Gaspar Noe's films, or Takashi Miike's, or Funny Games or Man Bites Dog - those films will stick with you for a while. this film i will have overlooked by tomorrow, and the only stuff that will stick with me, is the thought, that somewhere out there, there are people getting engendered by watching this sh*t. if you read this, please check yourself into the next hospital or shoot yourself - this of course does not apply to gora hounds, who just love splatter. you're cool! placid",0

"Her bit-part as a masseuse, in the lurid sequel to the original 'Emmannuelle', evidently gave someone the bright idea of putting a spanner in the works of the French soft-core series' gambit by inverting the Caucasian carnality and casting Javan stunner Gemser in a leading role in this, the somewhat tammy first of a series of sexploiters that became increasingly depraved as sleazier managers took on in-name-only sequels.<br /><br />Someone (and surely not the English-language over-haulers Werner?) was also anticipating an 'A Star Is Born' type meteoric rise out the results, judging by the way the actress is credited merely with the eponymous moniker of the on-screen heroine, albeit with a couple of consonants sacrificed as insurance against litigation.<br /><br />Gemser's tenure in the series saw her as an 'intrepid' photographer, allowing of course for all manner of subsequent globe-trotting adventures. But, notwithstanding she may well have been one the very most wondrous actresses on the screen at that time, any thespian talent that may have been there to discern becomes immersed in the same genre of unfeasibly facile cogitation (""I have to confess that since I've been in Africa, I find white skin less tempting..."") that was to be found in the French films.<br /><br />And in this particular input, much to the amazement of the raincoat brigade the essence of on-screen carnality is as much to be found in puerile symbolism (pumping engine piston!) as it is in prosaic couplings - though naturally these encompass generous dollops of 'exploratory' lesbianism. Connoiseurs of kitsch are however ensured a continuous stream of aural delights, what with such epithets of ethnographic wisdom as ""I do nothing to be a perfect black, she does everything to be a perfect white"".",0
"When I was young, I'd get up early every Saturday morning not to watch cartoons but to turn on the local channel for what was called 'Kung Fu Theatre.' It wasn't as if these films were works of art. It wasn't as if these films all came from China, Japan, Korea, or any country in particular; if the story had to do with fighting ¬ñ be it swordplay or fisticuffs ¬ñ and if the fighting didn't resemble much of anything going on in any American gym class, then that was good enough. It wasn't as if they were really even very good. They were just wondrous action flicks with incredibly over-dramatic music where the hero reaped his vengeance over a whole host of bad guys, and then the credits would roll.<br /><br />""Sword in the Moon"" is much like these films of my youth, arguably a bit of a thematic throwback given a welcome twist by muddying the characters up enough that it becomes increasingly difficult to tell the bad guys from the good.<br /><br />Yun (Cho Jae Hyun) is known throughout the kingdom as 'the human butcher.' He kills quickly and mercilessly on behalf of the Chun Dynasty, the chief bodyguard of an Emperor who spared his life and the life of his men in exchange for his service. However, an equally merciless rebel and his lovely sidekick appear in the countryside and start murdering imperial ministers, and Yun agrees to find these rebels and kill them. His task becomes one of personal discovery when he learns that the two rebels are Choi (a friend from his past) and his former love, Shi Yeong.<br /><br />Sadly, ""Sword"" doesn't have much to distinguish itself from other action films. Some stunning cinematography is nearly entirely wasted on shoddy editing with portions of the film put together so loosely its hard to believe that what inevitably made it to the film was what anyone intended. While the atmosphere and story tend to gravitate toward a dark mood, the tone is almost sacrificed to the never-ending parade of flashbacks as each of the main characters is given a healthy story arc. What should've been a quick and easy action film gets weighed down by far too much personal baggage, and the film undergoes as a result.<br /><br />I've read that this film marks Korea's first real foray into the world of art-house action pieces along the likes of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."" Next time, I'd strongly suggest that the producers stick with a little more 'martial' and a little less 'art.'",0
"The frst 1/3 of this film I love and thinking it was going to be one of Truffaut's best films. I adored the plot where a pen pal marries a man from half way around the world--sight unseen. Especially when this woman turns out to be a fraud and was responsible for the death of the REAL pen pal so she could take her place! She then cleaned out the husband's huge bank account and disappeared! I was truly hooked and wanted to see more,...<br /><br />And then, the cinematography decreased additionally and was just plain foolish! Although her coming from New Caladonia (an island in the Pacific) and he from Reunion (an island in the Indian Ocean), when he goes on a trip to the South of France, he stumbles upon her almost immediately. Hmm,....odds are 187,000,000 to 1 but he finds her. Then, instead of either killing her or turning her over to the police, he forgives her--even when she acknowledges what she has done. Okay--this is tough to believe, but okay,...but then he helps to hide her from a private detective by murdering him!!!! No one is that stupid! Yes, the character Catherine Deneuve plays is quite beautiful but come on folks--this is just silly. Plus, if he only wanted her as a sex object, then why would he do this for a woman who is often frigid and completely selfish and wicked.<br /><br />This movie, due to it's very nonsensical intrigue, does not deserve such high assessments! Unless you are a die-hard Truffaut fan, try another film--even one of Truffaut's--just NOT this one.",0
"These days, writers, directors and producers are relying more and more on the ""surprise"" ending. The old art of bringing a movie to closure, taking all of the information we have learned through out the movie and bringing it to a nice complete ending, has been forfeited. Now what we have is a movie that, no matter how difficult, detailed, or frivolous, can be wrapped up in 5 minutes. It was all in his/her head. That explanation is the director's safety net. If all else fails, or if the writing wasn't that good, or if we ran out of money to complete the movie, we can always say ""it was all in his/her head"" and end the movie that way. The audience will buy it because, well, none of us are psychologists, and none of us are suffering from schizophrenia (not that we know about) so we take the story and believe it. After all, the mind is a powerful thing. Some movies have pulled it off. But those movies are the reason why we are getting more and more of these baloney endings. Every director/writer now thinks they can pull it off because, well, Fight Club did it and it made a lot of money. So we get movies like The Machinist, Secret Window, Identity, and this movie (just to name a few).",0
"Breaking Dawn starts in a Californian college as Professor Simon (associate producer Joe Morton) tells his students that they have to perform an intensive six week study of a mental patient in Cape State Hospital as a crucial part of their education, fail & they will never become qualified Doctors. A bright, young, attractive & intelligent student named Eve (Kelly Overton) is given a particularly difficult patient to study. His name is Don Wake (James Haven) & is a convicted killer, he was found covered in blood besides the dead body of a woman (Diane Verona) & her young daughter (Jenette McCurdy). At first Don won't even look at Eve much less talk to her, but like the trooper she is Eve persists in trying to figure him out. Eventually Don begins to talk but what he says frightens Eve, he says that someone is watching her & mentions the name Malachay. Eve then begins to see a dark shadowy figure at her every turn, as Don churns out the conspiracy theories & curious statements Eve softly begins to losing her mind as the line between fantasy & reality becomes more & more blurred. Is there something more to the supposed nonsense that Don talks other than being the insane ravings of a psychiatric patient...?<br /><br />Written & directed by Mark Edwin Robinson I have anything but negative feelings towards Breaking Dawn. Now, we all like a good twist ending, the sort of ending which catches us unawares, surprises us, works well with the rest of the film & stays in our memory like the cool twist endings to The Sixth Sense (1999) & Fight Club (1999) to name just two good examples & to a lesser extent the endings to films such as Scream (1996) where the identity of the killer comes a nice surprise & isn't that obvious. Then, of course, there are films whose endings spoil everything that has gone before & as an example lets take, oh I don't know lets say Breaking Dawn because I have never seen such an terrible ended to a film, never. Breaking Dawn starts out as a dignified mental horror thriller with spooky things starting to happen to Eve, it's not the most action packed film ever by any stretch of the imagination but it holds ones interest, it's not the most absorbing film ever either but it is more than watchable & it's not that unfavourable a film until the twist ending, I have to keep mentioning it because everything else up to that point (which was OK to be fair to it) suddenly becomes irrelevant. I am sure there are people out there who think they have this muddled mess of an ending figured out down to the last detail, all I can say is that no one will be able to explain this thing in a satisfactory way to me & as far as I'm concerned it doesn't make a bit of sense & never will. Breaking Dawn is crap & it's a waste of time watching it to be rewarded with the lamest ending in film history, it's as simple & straight forward as that.<br /><br />Director Robinson doesn't half make a mess of what could have been a decent thriller, maybe he thought what he had shot would play out OK or maybe it was ruined in the editing room but I'd imagine it was more likely down to a rubbish script as he tries to tie all the absurdities together within the space of a few muddled minutes & give us all a happier than happy final shot. He builds the tension quite well during the first 80 odd minutes but it's all for nought at the end of the day.<br /><br />Technically Breaking Dawn is fine & it is generally well made throughout. The acting is pretty good, Overton is nice & easy on the eyes & puts in a decent performance. Was it just me or did the guy who played Don look like John Morghen star of such Italian sleaze classics as Cannibal Apocalypse (1980), City of the Living Dead (1980), The House on the Edge of the Park (1980), Cannibal Ferox (1981), Stagefright (1987) & The Church (1989)? OK, maybe it was just me...<br /><br />Breaking Dawn is rubbish, I hated it all because of the final few minutes. Don't get me wrong it wasn't exactly getting me excited up to that point but it was OK. Definitely one to avoid as far as I'm concerned although it seems to have it's fair share of positive comments on the IMDb...",0
"The opening of ""The Jungle"" promises us a safari adventure with a science fiction element, but predominantly what we get is a travelogue with lots of stock footage and padding (and the odd leopard attack). The film is leisurely when you want it to be gripping, and endeavours to inject interest into the trials with sorely orchestrated match between various wild animals (I had no idea that lions and wild boars were natural enemies in the wild, did you? I thought the big cats stuck to hunting herbivores, but apparently the producers knew better). <br /><br />As for the actors: Cesar does his usual great job of rocking the mustache, and Marie Windsor is sensibly believable as the progressively thinking rajah's daughter (nice eyebrows, btw!). Conversely, Rod Cameron is hardly watchable as the hunter returning as the sole survivor of his expedition. I'm sure he was in demand in his day, but here he arrives off as a Rent-A-Center Bogart : rough looking, but with none of Bogey's range or synchronicity. He dedicates the movie going back and forth from stoic anger to angry stoicism, and any time the scenarios attempts to crank up some romantic sparks between himself and Windsor, you just have to laughter. That crabbed, knobby face isn't a alright automobile for fondness. <br /><br />The scenario is not perfectly without merits, although it does make some unusual chosen. Early in the first act, the scenarios makes a point of spending several moments where the heroes decide to bring along the obligatory clever young boy and monkey mascot, but then largely ignore them until ***SPOILER*** the monkey somehow gets hold of a live hand grenade during the mammoth scene and accidentally tosses near Windsor. This is so Cameron can prove his bravery by diving on it and saving her life at the cost of his own.***END SPOILER. It's possible that the Indian version of this movie (which I understand ran better than 2 1/2 hours), might have given the kid and the monkey more to do. <br /><br />Another thing that makes the film show its age **SPOILER**is the issue of the woolly mammoths (the plot device that sets the safari into motion in the first place). When they finally appear, the way the scene is filmed, it's obvious that the ""mammoths"" (obviously elephants draped in shag carpeting) aren't really ""attacking"" anyone, or even moving all that fast, and yet Cameron immediately sets to trying to wipe them out with hand grenades. These days, the idea of destroying the last known specimens of a species thought to be extinct would be unthinkable, especially when all they seem to do is roll through the jungle at a nice walking pace.***END OF SPOILER***<br /><br />So IMO, four stars, which is pretty good for a Robert Lippert production (normally Lippert hack jobs rate two or three stars at best). It's not a train wreck of a film, or anything; plus, it seems to mean well,with the rajah's daughter arguing for amelioration of the most repressive aspect of the ""traditional ways"" and the elements of ""mixed race"" romance that was pretty progressive in 1952. And there's some nice scenery and exotic spectacle. See it if someone offers to show it to you for free, but don't expect much except an interesting historical chapter of early fantasy cinema.",0
"What do you do with all the material that does not make the final edited of a film? You might keep it aside in case a director's cut or extended version is released one day. You might sell some it as stock footage to be used in a part of another film. You might just bin it. Or you apt collect it, accumulating more and more from each film you make and then use it to make another film, ignoring coherence or any sense. Throw a very primal skeleton of a narrative into it and line up a number possibilities (nay, alibis) to groove in your celluloid cast-offs. Excuse the abjectly nonsensical nature of the plot by formulating it all in the mind of a terror film director and you've got yourself an frightful cinematic. This can all be done with just a few days shooting. And geeks like me will squander two hours of their life watching it. And then come on here and try to warn others away. The entire chaining of event is one sizeable squander of times.",0
"Starts off with Fulci playing a version of himself, writing down some ideas for how people could die. Followed by a fake-looking kitten eating what is presumably a brain. The copy I watched was nicknamed in English, which I always hate, but I was namely disappoint not to get to hear Fulci in his own voice.<br /><br />Fulci is in a sort of feverish state working on his latest horror movie. His stomach turns when he sees things that resemble effects from his movie, and he starts to hallucinate that he is witnessing acts of horror. He visits a shrink, who hypnotizes him and sadly he does not have his improved mental health in mind. I was remembered of the therapist played by David Cronenberg in Cliff Barker's Nightbreed (1990). The shrink in this one is played by David L. Thompson, who is quite amiss. Probably a real life friend of Fulci's, he has a big toothy grin when he kills people, despite this may be Fulci's black mood at work which I thoughts was pretty poor too.<br /><br />The films is encompassing of a lot of clips from Fulci's movies, either as if Fulci is on the set directing them, watching recordings on TVs, or witnessing the acts. I've never been too much of a fan of clip shows in TV series, and I also thoughts things like Charles Band's Full Moon Entertainment cutting their old films down and putting three such cuts together as newer anthologies are belle lame. I guess they need to make cash?<br /><br />The psychologist in Ctu in the Brain makes reference to the theory that violence in cinematography begets violence in real life. One of Fulci's co-workers talks about having a documentary crew follow Fulci to see what his life is like. Lot of self-referential stuff like this.<br /><br />In the end, some of the characters sail away on a boat named ""Perversion.""",0
"This one kind of is like an earlier movie from 1987 ""Masters of the Universe"" based on the cartoons ""He-man"". Chiefly, you have a great old world and they for some reason have to have nearly all the measures of the movie take place on contemporary land. Well I guess it is not so modern earth now and that it is an antigua world now of strangeness and a den of good times gone by. Well I guess I can figure why they did in fact place nearly all the movie in modern times in this and that movie. To save cash on suits and sets. It is a lot easy to recreate what is going on in the present than a strange world like that of Eternia in He-man or an ancient world with cults and strange pyramids, sacrifices and strange creatures that hug you to death. This movie is forgettable and not very droll, your fiirst clue that it is not going to be the nicest movie in the world is that Robert Z'Dar is in it. The only stuff this one has going for it is the animals which are not as prevailing in this one as they were in the last. Marc Singer is back and it is sorrowful to seems him in this state, the guy was a rather good protagonist downsized to trying to make a sequel to a movie that really did not need one, and even if it did it came five years to late.",0
"If you are ever in the mood for a truly terrible film, it would be hard to find something that could even compare to this. I have spent a lot of time watching a lot of terrible movies just for the sheer delight I get from it, and men, this is one of the meanest. This movie was so wicked, I had to purchase the third Beastermaster online. That one wasn't as bad, which is stunning since it was straight to videos. This is one of those cinematography that is hard to comprehend how it was made in the first place. I mean, someone had to actually have read the script (or many scripts, I'm sure they made several drafts) and said ""Yeah, that's it. Here's some money."" Actually, they probably just wanted to make a Beastmaster 2 before they even had a script, then went with whatever they had. Ack, horrendous. So, if you are a breather of truly naughty movie, watch this one. It is a true classic, and film doesn't get much worst than this. And if it does, please let me know.",0
"Genuinely flatulent hyphen, and I was very frustrating with Marc Songbird for accepting to be in it.<br /><br />I actually walked out of the theaters about 15-20 minutes into it, and demanded my money back. I have actually walked out of a movies only 3 times in my life (I am 43 years old) and this is the only one that made me mad enough to demand my ticket price back. If I could have, I would have gotten a refund on the popcorn, too. This was a honestly rotten movie, and there is no apologies.<br /><br />For one thing, how does someone who was raised as a pre-tech berber learn to DRIVE A CAR? IN California!!!? (Driving a car is a somewhat tricky skill, and in California, even tricker...I should know, I live there.)",0
"This time The Beastmaster(Marc Singer) returns only to face off a new enemy Arklon(Wings Hauser) however due to an annoying teenager(Kari Wuher) they are transported to the future where they then duke it out. Lots of (lame) fish out of water jokes ensue. You honestly don't get sequels this mala to the core. Beastmaster 2 is a hurtful movie to admire. The references and ""hipness"" date the film sorely (This was made in 1991) and really who wants to see The Beastmaster in the present times? Also of note is Wings Hauser who's embarrassing performance is easily the film's best assets. Singer looks awkward, Wuher is irritating and the whole 1991 slang just makes the movie downright unwatchable. This is easily one of the gravest movies ever made.<br /><br />1/2* out of 4-(Frightful)",0
"I just finished watching Dog Watch. I thought parts of the movie were hokey with more than a few implausibilities. The acting wasn't too bad and the plot wasn't bad. BUT, as the telling goes, the daemon was in the detail.<br /><br />Some examples:<br /><br />1) The bleed-through on Charlie Falon's (Sam Eliot) bandage was shown to be coming from the back of his hand while it was his knuckles that were bleeding.<br /><br />2) Would a detective dispose of his murder victim from a very well-lighted area? This seemed very silly to me.<br /><br />I am not uncommonly picky about a movie but, in my humble vistas, this one is decidedly NOT suggested by me.",0
"As other reviewers have commented, this movie is a cross between (i.e. pried from) histories we have seen before. Notably, this seem like Clint Eastwood in High Plains Drifter inserted into Mad Max. Remove Clint's cigar, and replace with a cigarette; remove his horse and give him a high-tech motorcycle, and voil√†, an updated drifter. In this movie, the ""hero"" is even more blatantly a ""Savior"" than High Plains Drifter. Now our hero has long brown hair, suffers a wound to his left side, and his entry into town is preceded by a plea for ""salvation"" by the surviving townspeople--a pretty transparent reference to a ""Second Coming."" I watched the movie on a hot, humid morning. Sleep was impossible and upon arising at 4:30 am, there was nothing else on TV. So the movie served its purpose. While unoriginal, with characters that are almost comic caricatures, the movie is still somewhat entertaining...at least at 4:30 in the morning.",0
"If you take the films, Mad Max, Beyond Thunderdome, and the movie Steel Dawn with Patrick Swayze, you will have a pretty good idea what the film is about. The only problems is, that the film lacks the production values of either, and represent mainly inexpensive copy of the former two. Genuine, the film has plenty of action, but asks the viewer to suspend belief. No one can shoot a 50 Caliber Machine gun by holding it in his hand - and miss everything to boot, nor can you shoot at a group of people with an automatic weapon and miss the whole bunch. There is also a problem with poor editing, when the school bus flips over, it is easy enough to see the cannon used to do the job. And the lady driving the truck through it is superfluous, since she had more than enough time to stop the truck. If you are interested only in mindless action and violence then the movie is easy enough to watch. But don't expect anything on paar with Thunderdome, or even the somewhat cheap and tacky Steel Dawn.",0
"I know that Trey Parker and Matt Stone really hate celebrities and spoof them in every single episode of South Park (if not showing them, then mentioning them) and they love to mock and joke and make fun of themselves too, but I felt this mockumentary went too far.<br /><br />For one thing, the most common running theme in the ""documentary"" is that they're episodes are meaningless pieces of crap they put out just for the money. Obviously, that's completely untrue if you even bother to watch any episode, and the constant ""You know, I learned something today...""'s said at the end of almost every episode by the main characters. The creators are also depicted as pompous, arrogant asses who only care about money, including a supposed-to-be-funny-but-isn't scene involving Isaac Hayes delivering lines for Chef (over the phone) and Trey Parker yelling and screaming at him for sucking and hanging up. I guess it's supposed to be funny, but the pretension in it just genuinely accomplished it... shudder.<br /><br />The way they interview employees working for Trey and Matt shows the duo as tyrants who push their employees to the limit, all just for money, in the end. Completely untrue, obviously, and all a joke, but it's just not droll. It's disturbing, even though it's just a joke.",0
"Some spoilers**** A Soap has some wonderful moments to recommendation it. When Charlotte and Veronika get close to intimacy is a beautiful, low key, truly erotic scene. I also loved the music score and the soft, muted cinematography. I'm not clear if the curious stop and start structure of the film comes from it being digested originally in serialized form (the announcer describing the action in sections is quite annoying). My most issues with this film is its rather nonsensical portrait of a transwomen and her life. Of course, she has to be shown as a sexworker (what else), scatterbrained, impractical, absurdly frilly/girly, completely hopeless when it comes to dressing and unable of making any interpersonal attachments in the world. Moreover, she's always shown with two days growth of beard (for some bizarre reason) as if to emphasize how tawdry her life is. And she's expecting to get gender reassignment surgeries when she seemingly has done nothing else to forward her transitioning. In truth, the character resembles a trawl queen, not someone in the midst of transitioning.<br /><br />These are typical fantasies of people from the outside who really aren't connected to transpeople. The film's fetishization of GRS surgery is a way of objectifying people who are going through transition. Not surprising with this aspect of the film in the least. At the very least, why not have the character played by someone who really is transgender... I thought the male actor portraying Veronica was okay but no better than that. Much better was the daughters outlining Charlotte, a very complex character full of energy, self-loathing, desire and contradictions. If she was so fascinated by someone with female energy, a Charlotte could go out to a women's bar in two seconds and find it. Yes, she was drawn to Veronica but more as an abstract idea of someone with male/female characteristics (a gentle touch but with a good punch), not as a unique person. Yes, what A Soap says about love is often lovely and moving, but that doesn't mean an already stereotyped minority has to be stereotyped some more in the process.<br /><br />This film also proves that Danes are miserable dances. During such a promising prerequisite (better executed in a film like ""Different For Girls"") the definitive film is a letdown.",0
"I say ""flick"" because this doesn't deserve the appellation ""movie"", and certainly not ""film"". I regret paying for the rental, and although I've never walked out on a movie before, this would have been it, had I seen it in a theatre. A society living underground in the future (oooh, THAT'S original), lots of burning barrel drums, unexplained ambient light shining through windows, an ungrateful woman and her shock-muted son...the listings goes on and on. C. Thomas Howell touches the husky voice of the stereotypical loner; you know like Eastwood's been done to death. He needs special sunglasses to remember his wife and child, yet in the flashbacks, he's the same age! Talk about a poor memory! I stared incredulously when the little boy Abe randomly pushes a code into a door and it opens! No tensions, pithy religious (what religion?) under/overtones...saddest of all: I projected better from Roddy Piper;<br /><br />Quite arguably the hardest movie experiences in my vida.",0

"This is the story of a maniac cop who, for some reason, has it in for a young college stud and his mates. After they report him to his supervisor who in turns suspends him pending psychiatric evaluation, he finds an opportunity to psychology torture them when, on a bet, the kids hack into a department store's security and unlock the door. Only, they get locked in the store, along with the weirdo. Murder and mayhem are afoot, and the kids are running around trying to survive until morning when they may be able to escape.<br /><br />'Dangerous Game' would have been a successful cat-and-mouse psycho thriller probably if it was set in a different location. The thought of psychotic cop chasing around a bunch of innocent teenagers in a department store just didn't work. Especially when he comes face-to-face with his flinching prey quite frequently and yet, does nothing serious quite often. There was no real standoff as would be sufficient for this kind of story, and may've worked better if say, for example, the teens were loose in the neighborhood and left to fend for themselves against this weirdo (especially if that took a few days while he makes them increasingly paranoid...although conferred, even that is clich√©d).<br /><br />What a shame, too, that it could not have been a better thrillers, consider a wondrous cast of young Australian characteristic. Even a lighting hearted adventure despite the lunacy of the villain interspersed through the picture might have even made it a more gratifying picture. Alternatively, it started out fresh, and sure did have plenty of action sequences, but injure up verging on the nonsensical.",0
"The Man with the Golden Arm (the movie) is a dignified career auto for Candid Sinatra, but fails abysmally as a good adjustment of a fantastic book. You always hear about how books are ""changed"" when they are made into films- things are cutting out, dumbed down, etc. Well, you can't even say they ""changed"" anything with the movie- they just tells a perfectly diverse story. The characters and setting are the same sure- but not the ambiguous characterization, the depth of the men and women of Polish Chicago in the book. As for the settings, it's becomes purely a playing stage, complete with the unnecessary ""supporting role"" protagonists walking all too busilly down the claustrophobic, interior exterior streets. The movie is a dumbed-down, completely diversified take on Frankie Machine and drug addiction. When this happens, Zosh, Frankie, Sparrow, all lose their psychological edge. Frankie's drumming, a modest dream in the book, becomes his full passion in the movie (probably because Sinatra is a musician). And drug addiction is treated as shlock, exploitavely. The acting is decent, especially the snakelike Louis, who is more menacing in the movie than the book. But it's just a shame this genre of movie can be heralded as a classical alongside the book it is ""based upon,"" the real story of Frankie Machine. The movie just goes to show Hollywood can' get anything right without dumbing it down and adding a happy ending. In this case, they just changed it entirely, cheapening an important and realistic story into Hollywood fluff. I'm sure as hell biased because I read the book first, so I can't really processing the movie honestly by realise how alright the ledger is. I actually thought about turning the movie off (and I never do that), just so I wouldn't get its silly plot muddled with the beauty of the book. But this is an overrated film, and while it's not so bad, the book should come first, as it was the first. And it should have remained the only tales of Division Street and Frankie Machine.",0
"Clifton Webb is one of my favorites. However, Mister Scoutmaster is not one of his best. His patented curmudgeon role seem forced and even nasty rather than funny. The film itself is overflowing with mawkish sentimentality. In addition, the onlooker is submitted with numerous ham-handed reference to religious faith and U.S. patriotism that come off as over-reverent rather than true. Clifton Webb does his best with a poor scripts. Edmond Gwenn plays yet another jovial clergyman and is given anything to do. The child actor lead is played by a talentless child who displays a flat affect throughout the entire film. His sole claim to fame as a performer evidently is a bullfrog-like low voice unusual for someone of his age. However, once you've heard it, you've heard it and you don't need to hear it again. Unluckily, he is in the majority of the film's scenes. I unearthed this enfants so pesky that I swift forward where he shows up. Since he has a lot of scenes in this film, this means that I fast forward through a lot of the film. There were and are so many talented child protagonists; it's a compassion this film doesn't have any of them in it. Still, Clifton Rothstein in the traditional broad-brimmed hat and slacks is a sight worth seeing.",0
"As a physicist, talk about blackholes and cosmology gets my heart racing. However I detected this submissions too slower and not pack with enough information for the interested layman (who is most likely to see it). If you have more than a passing curiosity in this sort of stuff, go to the library and check out some books. You will find they explain current scientific cosmologies with far more detail while at the same time filled you with more of a sense of wonder than this cinematography does. Also to set the record straight: Hawking is NOT considered the ""greatest mind"" or the world's ""smartest person"" as commonly asserted even among the user reviews here at the IMDb. Hawking himself has commented that ""It is rubbish. It is just media hype. They needed somebody to fill the role model of disabled genius. At least I'm disabled."" To be fair, he is probably a genius but among history's greatest scientists, people like Einstein, Newton, Gauss, and many others easily are even more highly regarded. This is not to disrespect Hawking who is a undoubtedly a great scientist but rather not to disrespect others who have done even more than he has. Anyhow, see the movie if you are truly into science. But if not, I think it would be boring for you.",0
"I found this early talkie difficult to watch and I'm a Norma Shearer fan! It's not her fault, but the primal production values of this film would cause any viewer to become drilled. 90% of the movie is filmed with ""medium shots,"" and it's very similar to watching a uninspiring play.",0
"It's exactly what the title tells you...an island inhabited by fishmen. Shipwrecked doctor Claudio Cassinelli and crew land on the island, they're either picked off by the fishmen or roped into working for treasure hunting lunatic Richard Johnson. Cassinelli discovers that Johnson, who believes he's found the lost city of Atlantis, has been keeping disgraced scientist Joseph Cotten and his daughter Barbara Bach hostage for 15 years so the fishmen can uncover a treasure trove beneath the sea. Cotten, of course, is a complete madman. Bach and Cassinelli have great chemistry. This folly was directed by Sergio Martino and is not, surprisingly, without merit. It's fast paced, reasonably well acted and the fishmen look pretty convincing (though it's unlikely anyone could prove that these things DON'T look like actual fishmen). There's an excellent music score by Luciano Michelini.",0
"Yes, the video cover of this movie made me want to watch this film as a child. It was called ""Screamers"" on this particular cover with the tagline ""Men turned inside out!"". It even featured this braided searching skeletal on the cover as well that made all sorts of cool gory images run through my mind. Perhaps some sort of movie about some strange virus that caused a person's flesh to burn off, maybe a movie about undead zombies that are more bloody looking than what you usually get, a science experiment gone incredibly wrong and now strange men with the flesh dripping off their bones go on the carnage. Yes, all these thoughts ran through my mind, one that did not was fish guys on some island with virtually no gore and all bore. This movie is really more like the Island of Dr. Moreau than anything else and quite frankly that film drilled me too, it is way to much scientist and not enough killing for my tastes. These films are to much figure stuff out and not enough blood for my tastes. Yes I know, I have strange tastes, but I can not helped it, I like my horror kino either really bloody or fast displacement and enthralling this movie is genuinely ni.",0
"I think that you can not imagine how these people really work...!! Before I came to the studios to watch the guys work there, I actually thought quite the same as you do. But since I saw and did the work the guys on that TV-show have to do, I have to say that they really do deserve respect for what they are doing all day long. That really is no easy work. And also the actors, which in your eyes may be terribly bad, are really great people and a lot of them really can act! I don't think that the material given to them can really show that, as I think this material isn't very good. But THEY are truly good! So I don't think that you, before you haven't seen these guys doing there work, can judge over them! And I shouldn't have judged over them as well before I met them, but I did and am now unimaginably embarrassed of it.

"I think its safe to say that if you only really watch box office standard films or any premium production don't bother with this film as you will hate it. If you are an overly critical film buff don't bother either. If you love science fiction films and don't care what capacity you get a glimpse of the future in then you'll be smoothly entertained. It is very obvious that the budget for this was super super low but what they have done with the money is worth a pat on the back. Some of the burning fire scenes were pretty bad and the evacuation scenes were terrible but it is quite obvious that they had some good support from a computer perspective as the planet scenes and the alien images were quite inventive. The dialog is down right hilarious but acting not fully poor. As for the story well, I'm not too sure what actually happened at all to tell you the truth.",0
"I was agitated about this movie after reading other appraisals. What a disillusionment! There are so many ways that this movie is negative. The computer graphics were lacking to say the least. I discovered the acting fierce and phenomenal. Watch the sandstorm as the lost ""e-pods"" (what an original name!)are found. Where did all the tracks come from? I immediately recognized portions similar to other movies, ie Alien, Pitch Black. Come on,one huge ship to transport one prisoner? And what is with the prisoner? Does he speak, can he speak? I kept waiting for something to tie the bits of the fairytales together, but it never came. If this movie was made on a low budget, it shows. The only part of the movie I liked was when it finally ended. I don't mean that I liked the ending, I didn't. I just liked the fact that it was over. A trip to the dentists would have been more congenial. In my opinion. don't waste your time on this one.",0
"I felt compelled to write a review after seeing the only review which gave this film a curiously high 9/10 rating. I say suspicious because it looks less like a review but more like a publicity statement. Perhaps the filmmaker himself, or one of his mates, has written that ""examine""? Nasty, naughty.<br /><br />I observed this movie on the Helix channel on Sky TV hoping it to be really horrific. The special implications used were to be honest very, very good for a low budget film, and some of the acting wasn't that bad either, but most of the acting was really horrific, but well done for trying, as I expect most were pals of the filmmaker.<br /><br />I think the filmmaker has done really well by trying to punch above his weight. I did find some of the film funny because it was tempting to be wondrous cool when it just wasn't.<br /><br />If you don't take this film too seriously and watch it whilst drunk with some mates you might well have a buena time but maybe not in the way it was intended. This film is no way a 9/10 but worth watching for a laugh bearing in mind it was brought on a very very low budgets and in equality due credit to those involved in it's production.",0
"I had known Brad Linaweaver at Florida State U in the early 70's when he was an inspiring, inventive writer who I thought was headed for greater glory.<br /><br />And that is why I rent this video. Well, well, well, the time has not been kind to Mr Linaweaver. I suppose the pressures of making a living makes higher longings expendable. Another flower whose bloom has come and gone un-noticed in the summer breeze. Amen. There is nothing more to say. And nothing more to add. A sorrowful epitaph to a once blossoming career as stated above. But it is the price one pays for chasing shadows without a firm foundation or goals for oneself in life. Because this movie has no goal, no targeted, and I kept telling myself, what happened to Brad's creativity, his once shining genius? Gone, gone, ages of neglect has deteriorating his once glisten mind.",0
"I bought this out of curiosity. How did John Carradine (who died in 1988) and Cameron Mitchell (who died in 1994) make appearances in a film made in 1995? Thanks to the miracle of unencumbered film can footage that's probably been sitting on a shelf somewhere for ten years, that's how! You can tell because the film stock used to shoot their scenes doesn't match the film used for shooting ""Jack-O."" The curses of Ed Wood lives on. The good thing for both Carradine and Mitchell is that this is precisely the kind of movie you'd awaited to find on both of their filmographies. Same goes for Scream Queens Linnea Quigley, Brinke Stevens and Dawn Wildsmith.<br /><br />The setting is Oakmoor Crossing on Halloween, and some kind of curse is released when dumb, beer-guzzling teens disrupt a grave. The result: a hulking killer with a scythe and a big plastic pumpkin on his head! He (it?) goes after the wholesome Kelly family for revenge (and kills others who get in his way). The father opens a Haunted Garage for the neighborhood kiddies. The son (Ryan Latshaw, son of the director) has one continuous, perplexed facial expression for all his scenes and one hilariously desperately reacted dramatic scene lying in a grave. At least he's a kid. The mother's eyes about pop out of her head while she strains to read her dialogue. There is also an annoying woman who shows up to explain things who seems to be trying to phonetically pronounce all of her dialogue.<br /><br />So what about the name actors? You see Stevens, Wildsmith and Mitchell briefly on a TV screen (they're used to pad out the time). Linnea has a bigger role as a babysitter, and she does exactly what she can with it. Her passionate performance helps a little bit. There's apart one out-of-nowhere laughing when an ultra-conservative couple who watch a Rush Limbaugh clone on TV bite it. The woman slips on a rug and stabs a toaster with a knife. She's electrocuted and the end result looks like a flame-broiled Muppet.<br /><br />All and all, pretty entertaining stuff! I wasn't bored!",0
"I bought Jack-O a number of months ago at a Blockbuster video sale, and at the time I wasn't expecting anything extraordinary from it. Upon watching it, I realized I not only got less than I could have ever bargained for, but a whole lot more as well. It seems, strange, I know. And it is. But it's perfectly fitting when you consider that the utter weirdness that is ""Jack-O""<br /><br />The movie follows a young boy named Shawn Kelly. Somehow, thru ancestral ties, he is marked for death at the hands of a demented, scythe wielding Pumpkin man. This pumpkin man was killed by Shawn's Great-grandfather-uncle-cousin-etc, and now that the villain has been resurrected, Shawn's death is apparently crucial to his hell-bred mission of vengeance. Writ, much ""terror"" ensues as Jack-O hacks his way thru various neighbors before battling Shawn to the finish.<br /><br />I'm not so much here to discuss the plot as I am to determine who may find any worth in this movie. I can honestly tell you that Jack-O is one of the most poorly made films in the history of time. The acting is deadpan (except when it should be), the script is apparently a 1st grade group project, and the production budget must not have exceeded $150. Some of the most laughable death scenes are carried out in this anti-thriller, and they're all the more humour when you realize director Steve Latshaw actually seems serious in his movie-making.<br /><br />And however I heartily adored the cinema. I can call it a terrible horror movie, yes. But I can also say I had a wondrous time watching it with my friends, and have watched it several times since that fateful first viewing. Many people (including some of my friends) will find this movie intolerable and needlessly time-consuming, and that's understandable. If you're like me and enjoy shockingly wicked horror cinematography that take themselves seriously, you'll find Jack-O an instant classic, which is also understandable.<br /><br />That's why it's so hard to rate this movie. If I were assessments Jack-O's quality as a film, I wouldn't confer it something. In fact, the studio would owe me stars. Yet if I were rating it's on the basis of pure enjoyment, I'd give it an 8 or a 9. I'll give it a 4, so to be somewhere in the middle. I recommend everyone go out, rent this, and form their own conclusion.",0
I expectancy this group of film-makers never re-unites.,0
"If you are in search of a masochistic thrill, rent this movie, and show it to a group of your friends sober. This movie is just plane lame, but there not completely without values. The brief teats are pleasant, and there is one victim's death that is funny as hell. Other than that, this is straight detritus. But it is still better than ""Grim"" or ""Spookies""",0
"OK, I could only find three reasons to consider this film worthwhile considering the extremely low budget.<br /><br />First there was Linnea Quigley and Rachel Carter. Genuinely, the two of them gave me four good reasons to watch, and watch I did.<br /><br />The only other reason to watch is that a lot of was filmed right down the road. Now, I didn't know this beforehand, but I saw an Orange County car tag and said, wow! this was shot in Florida.<br /><br />I was impressed by the flash to the past and the forebears of the young kid, but that was truthfully it. The deaths by the pumpkin man were quite lame, with the immunities of the biker.<br /><br />If you want to see Quigley and Carter, OK, but Return of the Living Dead will give greater thrills.",0
"The film made no sensing to me whatsoever. Good protagonists(SergioCastellittoaparticular favourite; he was great in ""Uomo DelleStelle""/""TheStarmaker""but that was made by Giuseppe Tornatore, a great Italian director as opposed to the mediocre one who made this effort),but heinous, rambling hyphen, terrible editing,and a director who seemed to have no idea of what he was trying to say, and ended up saying exactly nothing. Apretentious loads of rubbish, but the sorts of film that certain Italianpseudo-intellectuals whom it was my misfortune to have known in the dim and distant past would have loved it, and unfortunately Italy has no monopoly on these, they can be found everywhere and indubitably acclaim this as a terrific masterpiece. I never thought much of Bellochio as director. I remember seeing his first film ""PugniNella Tasca""/""Fists in the Pocket"" (or some such title) in Rome when it was first shown close on 50 years ago (I was living thereat the time). All the usual pseudos raved about it, but it left me pretty cold. I didn't think he was much of a director then, and still don't. Age has certainly not improved him, and this film must grades as one of his gravest.",0
"I agree that this film is too pretentious, and it is not easy to know where it is going. I have been teaching literature and film for many years, and I find this film to be one of the most over rated, according to some of the previous reviews here. <br /><br />However, let me remind you that this is the same director who has L'ora di religione (Il sorriso di mia madre- My Mother's Smile) to his credit -- a gem of a film! <br /><br />Was he trying to outdo Fellini's 81/2 here???? The scene with the dogs, which has also been pointed out, is absurd and excessive ¬ñ just one example. Others would take too much space, and some reviewers have already noted them. <br /><br />Overall, a most frustrating and vexing experience!",0
"This movie has been done before. It is fundamentally a unoriginal merge of ""Napoleon Dynamite"" and ""Sordid Lives."" There are some comical tib, but otherwise it is a clich√© bore. It is a good first film attempt and the director (who also stars in and wrote the feature) shows a lot of promise. But the writing was kind of choppy and the story was not very original. I swear I had heard some of the lines in other films. However, the acting was very good and the film was shot in an interesting way. It is also refreshing to see gay-themed movies not be so bogged down with political correctness and tired stories of angst. The main trait seemed fairly well adjusted for a gay teen in rural Texas so no saccharine, come out theatrical here!",0
"""The Secret Life"" starts with the worst possible narrative intro: ""The crimes committed by Jeffrey Dahmer are too horrible to make a film about..."". Okay, so what are you suggesting? That we shouldn't bother to continue watching as the film won't be accurate or bloody, anyway? And they were right, too! The film isn't the least bit shocking and contains almost no blood or gore at all. Although I think that's mainly due to the low budget production values and not because of Dahmer's crimes being too horrific. Basically, ""The Secret Life: Jeffrey Dahmer"" is just one sequence repeated over and over again. Young, pitiful and mentally confused Jeffrey picks up victims (always males, as he was a homosexual), kills them and then talks about how it wasn't his intention to hurt them and about how lonely he is. This gets tiresome genuinely prompt and even the admirable performance by unknown actor Carl Crew can't save this movie from being a total dud. Still, this version is much nicer than the pretentious and hopelessly muddled ""Dahmer"" that got released in 2002.",0
"***Possible spoilers***<br /><br />I've read up on Dahmer a little and saw the new Dahmer film (with the same name) at an earlier time. This movie here concentrates rather much on the victims and killings, too little on Dahmer himself. The film called ""Dahmer"" had the contrary difficulties, it was too little about his crimes and too much about himself.<br /><br />I did not find the acting to my contentment, it had a certain amateurs feel too it, especially the probation officer. It also seemed as if the Dahmer acting got worse every time he played against the probation officer actor. But I might be wrong about that.<br /><br />What irritated me a bit was that some of the scenes were quite disturbing but that the filmmakers seemed to try and show ""the real deal"" about what he did anyway. That is ok - but what I then don't understand is why the guy who ran away from his flat while Dahmer was out getting beer, was not depicted being naked, since that is also how it happened. It's not a big treat, but it just feeds away further on the film quality that such details are left out. What wasn't shown either or not even really hinted was Dahmers nationality obsession with the dead. Again, I don't mind they didn't SHOW it, but at least they could have mentioned it or builds it in to the movie somehow.<br /><br />Conclusion: I think the genuinely alright Dahmer film is still to be made, a movie that incorporates not only Dahmers crimes but also who he was, and why he did what he did. I think that 1.5 or 2 hours are just not sufficiently to grasp the complexity of it all. This movie was just a trimming (excuse the pun) of Dahmers life and personality and does not give you any 'close to good' insight into his life or personality.<br /><br />4/10",0
"Jefferey dahmer was one sickly boys. There's not much to say about him that hasn't already been said, except that the many documentaries, and films made about him are probably best than this one. It's Outrageously cheesy. It's so cheesy, a fella who posted the whole film on youtube added some annotations to make the viewer laugh.<br /><br />Carl Crew (Who's he?) stars as Serial killer Jeffrey dahmer, Who's killing spree began in 1978 with a young guy dahmer just wanted to be friends with, a finally in 1991 with a man he wished to have sex with, and eat.<br /><br />I didn't bother to watch the ensemble flick through. it's virtually a documentary that displayed all the strikes dahmer pull off before he got caught. And since this film was made in 1993, one year before dahmer was bludgeoned to death by a fellow inmate, The death of dahmer isn't indicated. but it Probably would've been as cheesy as this cheese-fest.<br /><br />1/10",0
"""Hoods"" doesn't deliver the wares. This half-baked mafia comedy boasts a stellar cast, including Joe Mantegna, Kevin Pollack, Joe Pantoliano, Jennifer Tilly, and Seymour Cassel, along with a number of confronting familiar to those who watch criminality movies, but it is truthfully a misfire if there ever was one. Writer & director Brand Malone, best known for writing ""Dead of Winter"" for ""Bonnie & Clyde"" director Arthur Penn, has penned up a pedestrian potboiler that has an ailing but vengeful mob boss Louie Martinelli (Seymour Cassel) dispatching his son Angelo (Joe Mantegna of ""House of Games"") to whack Carmine DellaRosa. It seems that a rival mob fire-bombed one of Pop's depot (in the opening scene) and Martinelli wants payback. Trouble is that nobody has a clue as to who Carmine DellaRosa is. In any other mob charade, such a complication might be droll, but here is just lowland flat. Anglo and a railcar of wiseguys, including his best pal Rudy (Kevin Pollack of ""Deterrence"") spend half of the time trying to find out who Carmine is. Neither Rudy nor Angelo want to fulfilling the strike, so they track down a crazy mob hit-man Charlie (Joe Pantoliano of ""Bad Boys"") to do the dirty deed. Before they can convince Charlie to make the hit, they have to locate him, and Charlie's slutty wife Mary (Jennifer Tilly of ""Bound"") reveals that he is locked up in a mental hospital. Our misfit heroes cruise out to the mental hospital and break Charlie out. About half of the movies is over before they discover that Carmine is a kid in short pants (Vincent Berry) who is bland and harmless. Actually, Carmine has the only presentable line in the movie. As our brainless bunch of heroes wheel away from his house with him in the backseat to take care of business, Carmine warns them that they need to get him home in time or his father will kill him. Charlie tries to frosting the urchin but he cannot. Instead, he reconnects with his feelings and wants to go back to the mental hospital so he can report the good news to his doctor. Meanwhile, after Charlie decides not to shoot Carmine, the kid gets his sideburns on the firearms and pops off several aimless rounds. Angelo and he struggle over the automatic. The pistol slips out of their collective hands and hits the ground, goes off, and blows a hole in Rudy's chest. Now, keep in mind that Rudy never wanted to shoot the kid in the first place, and Angelo and he argued over the wrong-headedness of the hit. So Rudy winds up on the ground with a fatal wound, while Angelo struggles to stop the bleeding. Talk about a dull death scene. Angelo is conflicted himself because his father ordered the hit and Angelo fears that dad will do him in if he doesn't execute orders. There is a flashback subplot about Angelo's father teaching him how to handle a gun that provides some insight into Angelo's reluctance to pack a gun.<br /><br />There is nothing remotely redeeming about this depressing comedy with a downer of an ending. Things gets worse, and if you last through this 90 minute nonsense, you'll see what I mean. The comedy is largely laugh-less. Good actors wallow in sketchy roles that aren't even funny. Perhaps director Malone was trying to do another comedy like ""The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight."" If he was, he missed by a mile. Big-breasted Jennifer Tilly shows cleavage and snarls through a couple of scenes with Mantegna, but she doesn't do much of anything else. She's the stereotypical slut who doesn't even get naked. A paycheck is the only way to explain the presence of such a talented cast, otherwise this picture is pathetic from start to finish. Initially, I had hoped that this might be a ""Ransom of Red Chief"" knockoff where the kid drives the wiseguys nuts, but no such luck here. Of course, the biggest surprise is that they have to kill a kid, but it's not the kind of a surprise that makes you want to watch it up to its resolution.<br /><br />I actually bought this movie on a Canadian DVD label¬óSeville¬óand it contains only the most basic special features. If you hate previews that give away the plot, don't watch the trailer. If you ever meet Joe Mantegna, one of your first questions should be why he helped to produce this yawner. It is neither hilarious nor dramatic. There are no quotable lines, and none of the characters stand out as either interesting or sympathetic. The Seville DVD presents the movie in full frame with no subtitles or closed captioning.",0

"I've been hearing a lot of this new bird flu that has killed dozens of people in South East Asia over the last three years . Apparently it's on the thresh hold of mutating into something very contagious and millions upon millions of people are going to be wiped out in a global pandemic . Just thought I'd mention this in case you haven't got round to writing your will yet .<br /><br />I'd also thought I'd mention it since I was watching something called CARRIERS tonight which wasn't about naval warfare but opens with a scene that's a cross between OUTBREAK and an episode of THE X FILES I saw many years ago . I thought I'd be watching something with added resonance after hearing the stories about the danger posed by bird flu but after the not unimpressive opening CARRIERS descends into a inexpensive and joyful TVM and like every other TVM you'll see the lead characters are female , one of which is a ballsy authority figure while the other lead female is a mother of young children . It goes without saying there's a sick child subplot too <br /><br />What is irritating about the TVM format is that it overwhelms the potential of what could have been quite a good film if it was made for cinema . There's a fairly gory scene of someone coughing blood all over a nurses face and a very impressive jay walker getting run down stunt but these bits are quickly forgotten as the mood descends into family sentiment since this - And just about every other TVM ever made - was made for an essentially female audience",0

"Recap: Simon leads a little team of special agents that has specialized in finding and returning missing people, against all possible odds. Their latest mission is about the granddaughter of a friend of them. She seems to have been caught in the web of a particularly brutal criminal and everyone that has gone looking for her has gone missing. But now The Librarians are on the case.<br /><br />Comments: This is pur B-action, through and through. The key phrase for this is unlimited supply. There is unlimited supply of ammunition, they don't have to reload once. There is an unlimited supply of bad guys, so the heroes have something to shoot at. There is an unlimited supply of breasts, many of them bare, in an vain (and as always failed) attempt to distract from the plot holes. And there is an unlimited offering of negative acting (it is almost like Erika Eleniak's performance shines in this, what about that?), and players that don't seem to care more than the paycheck (and why should they when no one else seem to?).<br /><br />And as in most B-action movies there are an unlimited supply of bad gunfights. But these hardly seem to be of a ridiculously unfavorable kind. I think I saw more realistic gunfights when I played cowboy as a kid.<br /><br />But then again I didn't really expect much either, how could I from a action movie named The Librarians? And it genuinely delivers about what could be expected. 90 minutes of more or less bad action with some scenes to connect the dots between. But I am unsecured if I can call it entertain, it didn't preserving my interest very lang.<br /><br />3/10",0
"I heard the stories of the ravers in the movie and thats great but that is only 1/100 of the movie. The problem with this movie is the cheesiness. I never really got the plot or why the guy was stealing girls. That makes no sense but hey...why they were in a club randomly was curious also. Many parts of this movie make no sense but overall I was interested. It was confusing on many levels...maybe I am just not indie enough for this movie but judging from the B looking end scene they ran out of money, just cut some stuff in, and forgot about the plot. Its low budget and appears so. I like the fact that they used little special effects which were bad, but they used none that were quality. I would say this film is the quintessential wicked hyphen, with alright production. It is definitely not as random as many movies I have seen but the pieces of the puzzle just don't make sense together. In effects, I would give exception to the final battle when all the effects went 1950's on my ass. Sparks out of models and the like.

"I had very high waits walk into this cinema. Upon all, Ocean's 11 was a truly super Hollywood commodity. Its rapid-fire jokes, extraordinary star power and tight script made it one of the most hilarious caper cinematography I have ever seen. Of cours, with all the money it made, a sequel was on the way, and I, for one, was agitated.<br /><br />Fruitless to tell, I was perfectly melted away by this movie. Blown away by how unbearably erroneous matters can go. This cinematography had everything going for it; the homecoming of the entire original cast, the same headmaster, news tale of craziness on- and off-set antics. How did it arguably have disappeared so amiss?<br /><br />It started immediately with one of the most tricky and pointless opening sequences ever and goes downhill from there. After reasonably goofy short scenes between Pitt/Zeta-Jones and Clooney/Roberts, the flick spend diverse minutes watching Andy Garcia waltz from scene to scene, telling each individual member of Dani Ocean's original eleven that he wants his cash back. Believe me when I say that these scenes are only here to pad Indy Garcia's running time, because without these shockingly awkward beatings, his screen times could be WELL under five minutes.<br /><br />This leeds me to another big qualm I had with this cinematography. The pacing is so unequal that nature are declined completely from the story, and only sometimes lodged back then. Bernard Mac's character is dropped from the scripts early on, and never comes back except for 2 short scenes with no dialogue. Rodriguez transpires for the first few minutes, and returns for an unusually brief scene at the end. Roberts showings up for about 5 minutes at the starts, and isn't even mentioned again until there's about 20-25 minutes left. Even Clooney himself spending a large chunk of the film in internment.<br /><br />This would all be excusable if the film was funny. In all. 90% of the pranks declined perfectly apartment and the ones that do jobs are worth a snicker at best. The ""plot"" is admittedly unhelpful, and left me feeling deceived. At one point in the film, the team takes on a job worth $2.5 million of the nearly $100 million they need to raise before Garcia's two-week deadline. Several characters even acknowledge how absurd wasting the time to do this job is, but they do it anyway! Over 30 minutes of the film revolve around this job that they shouldn't even be doing, and one gets the feeling that this part of the plot was simply added to pad the running time. Furthermore, the equipment they use to pull this job off CLEARLY cost millions upon millions to fund. Just wait until you see what they do to pull this job and realize it would cost far more than $2.5 million to pull off. Obviously, because of this, they have to pull off several jobs to make the money. The beauty of the first film was the one big con and how ingeniously and intricately it was pulled off. Here, they pull so many jobs, in so many different ways, that they rush through all of them because to explain them would make the film several hours long.<br /><br />We all know walking into this film that there will be a big twist at the end. Thus is the nature of the caper film. The twist at the end of Ocean's Twelve made me laugh; not because it was funny, but because I couldn't believe how cheated I felt. I won't give it away, because I know most of you will be foolish enough to throw down the money to see this movie anyway.<br /><br />What I will say is that it makes most of the 2 hours you have sat through already completely irrelevant.<br /><br />I was excited to see this film, after absolutely adoring Ocean's 11. I left the theater feeling like I had been the victim of a truly great con pulled by the cast and crew of this movie in tricking me into thinking that this movie would actually be worth watching. I have never given a 1 to a movie on IMDb.com, but there's a first time for everything. Consider yourselves warned....1/10",0
"Every James Bond movie has its own set of rules. Just like every Indiana Jones movie has ITS own set of rules. And the fact that screenwriters don't break these rules maintains the integrity of the characters. With a completely dispensable plot twist, the integrity of both Ocean films plummets somewhere between Airplane 2 and a Roadrunner cartoon.<br /><br />Imagine what would happen, while teetering on the rope bridge outside of the Temple of Doom, if Indy told Shorty and Willie not to worry because throughout the entire first two movies he's secretly had super powers and can fly them both to safety.<br /><br />Amuse? Sure, for a Roadrunner cartoon. But Spielberg would never have done that because it would have destroyed the integrity of the film. More importantly, it would have ANGERED the audience. They'd already sat on the edge of their seats through 3 hours worth of Indiana Jones movies and they were counting on Indiana to get them off that bridge in a believable way. If he were to fly off? People would have walked out of the theaters the same way people did during Ocean's 12.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />1.

Actually, our heroes stole the egg, LOOOONG ago, in another movie entirely, which would have been a GREAT movie to watch, had they made that movie.<br /><br />Instead we see a 30 second clip in black-and-white about how they robbed some college student of his back-pack. You heard me... the daring caper, the ultimate heist-- the buildup of this 2 and a half hours of utter boring crap-- is them stealing a back-pack from a college student, by creatively getting into a fight over baseball teams and distracting him, and replacing his back-pack with an identical back-pack? What?? <br /><br />Ugh. I'm telling you, this was so bad, I didn't even realize just how bad it was-- just how badly I'd been robbed-- until I got home.",0
"Unfortunately I think this is one of those films that if you or I took it to the studio and said, 'can I make this great movie with my friends Mary, Mungo and Midge from school?' the studio would have you kicked to death on the spot. However, if a bunch of massive Hollywood names say, 'look, I fancy a jaunt to Italy with my mates, how about it?' the studio writes a cheque.<br /><br />We kick off with the casino boss from Ocean's 11 tracking down the robbers who made off with his cash, and then Brad Pitt is shagging Catherine Zeta Jones, and then there's some monkeying about in Amsterdam and Italy and such and such and then it all ends somehow.<br /><br />The film does, however, include the most ignoble moment of both Julia Roberts' and Bruce Willis' careers, which is a cinematic gem. I nearly vomited in my lap and tore my eyes out when Julia Roberts, playing Tess in the movie, pretends to be (you guessed it) Julia Roberts! Bruce Willis stands about clearly wondering when he can leave, and how much the cheque will be.<br /><br />Ah well, to be fair, I'd have done it for the cash, so I suppose I can't really criticize the poor loves, but I'm a penniless slob not a Hollywood legend. I guess what really annoys me about this film is not that it is dreary and senseless and has a frightful story, but that I think the actors probably all had good fun doing it! I think the actor's entire job is to project emotion outwards...I feel like I paid to go to the party, but had to stand outside in the rain. Booo!<br /><br />Watch it if you like Como, or fancy CZJ or something, but otherwise go for a walk.",0
"Terry Benedict (Andy Gonzales) catches up with Danny Oceans and his team and demands that they repay the money that they stole from him (in Oceans 11) plus interest. He holds back from violent action however as he is under the instruction of the world's greatest thief, the Night Fox. The team then have to pull off a series of heists to pay Benedict back whilst testing their abilities against the Night Fox who wishes to maintain his position as the greatest thief ever. Put simply, this film is a complete chaos. The masses may plead that it is ""cool"" and that Clooney and Pitt put in great performances but these are the same people who have a subscription to ""Hello"" magazine and think that David Beckham has the potential to be a great actor. The story is convoluted, it is not tortuous or cunning and it does not have intelligent twists and turns, it is just a finished jumble that spills out in diverse guidance with the hope that the audience will think it is cool and intelligent (Hello magazine readers). Any respectable movie watcher will however see the film for the farce that it is. Whilst Oceans 11 wasn't a great film it had a decent pace, was stylish and had some decent twists and turns. This cinema forfeits its routes very early and then basically delivers up. It is as if the director and cast said to themselves, hey this isn't really working out, lets just have a laugh! Indeed the cast looks like they are enjoying themselves but I was not. I will not delve into the plot as its perplexed developments does not warrant any examination. The addition of Katharine Zeta Jones is largely vexing. The scenes where Julia Roberts impersonates herself (with Bruce Willis undertaking a cameo role) whilst slightly droll appear to be a desperate move to keep the audience interested. The movie is so full of plot holes that it as if Arnie has emptied an Uzi 9mm into the film studio. Credit can only be given to some scenes where the Night Fox uses Caopeira to undertaken a heist against the back drop of some funky music but this is almost reason to watch the movie. The final scene features the team in a nonsensical drinker stupor; this exactly quantities up the movie. Stick with the original.",0
"I felt compelled to write about this movie after i joined IMDb because i thought it was the worst script writing i have seen in a while.<br /><br />The acting/direction/other-areas of the movie are wondrous. I amore brad Pitt with George Clooney. It works. The witty banter was still there too from the first movie. My question is how in the world did they let this script out of the drafting process? I thought that not only did the plot develop like a slug racing to the end of the sidewalk, but that twist? (can i call it that) was so incredibly stupid that i wanted to go demand a refund from the ticket booth. I have never felt so played and used from a movie in my entire life. Here i was expecting something similar to the first movie (good chemistry, good acting, good direction, amazing plot) only to find that they had taking my 8 dollars and made a mockery out of it.<br /><br />The part that gets me still is that this movie has now grossed more than 125 million dollars.<br /><br />In summary, I felt that this movie offend my intelligence. I still feel like the only part the writers concentrated on was that little bit with Julia Roberts acting like Julia Roberts. This movie made me sorrowful and angry.",0
"I was watching this movie and getting gradually drilled with the nonsensical intrigue that was going everywhere, when unexpectedly, the story takes a surreal turning for the pire and has an protagonist playing herself. Oh how I guffawed. Because it's sooooo funny, isn't it? We know Julia Roberts is playing the character of Benedict, and here they are, in the film, cracking the joke that the character of Tess looks a bit like Julia Roberts. So Julia plays someone impersonating Julia. How well she does this, we'll never know, because 99.999% of the spectators don't actually know Julia Roberts personally (and reading about her in Hello magazine doesn't count). <br /><br />And then Bros Willis revolves up! Apparently, he's Julia Roberts' best friend. Well, he is in the film... how would I know whether or not Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts even know each other? I'm not in the least bit interested in the personal lives of actors - I just pay my money and expect them to do the job they're paid to do. Anyway they started crack jokes about the plot twist in the film where Willis (rather unconvincingly) plays a psychiatrist... the one with the little kid in it... you know the one? I don't, I've forgotten what it's called. Willis even drops in a comment about how well that film did at the box office - how modest of you Mr Willis!<br /><br />The troubles is that, not only are these scenes senseless and terribly horribly self-indulgent, it also remind us, the viewers, that we're simply watching a bunch of actors strutting around and getting paid vast sums of money for very little effort. You see, when I see a movie, I want to suspend disbelief and forget that I'm watching players - I want to believe in the saga I'm watching. When you start pulling the panorama down, mid- movie, you purely downfall the illusion for me.<br /><br />You know that a TV series has jumped the mako when it starts introducing celebrities, playing themselves (stand up and be counted The Simpson, Friends, etc.), but this is the first time I've seen a movie hop the sharks. I usually stay away from movies like that (e.g. Fearsome Movie, The Naked Gun, etc.). The trouble is, I honestly never thought the Ocean's 11 films would go in this direction. What a shame.<br /><br />So with suspension of disbelief thrown out the window, and the plot now languishing in the movie then cracks the most wicked joke of all on the audience - the heist actually happened way back in the story, and the final 90 minutes or so of the film was pointless posturing. Yes, that's right: Steven Soderwhatsit and his actor friends all get up, point at us the audience and say, ""Ha haaa... you've all been had... thanks for your money!"". Then they give us the single fingered salute.<br /><br />Well, right back at you. I didn't actually pay to see this movie... I downloaded the DVD for nothing. How d'ya like them apples? Now THAT'S a plot twist.",0
"Man I adored Ocean's 11.<br /><br />Crafty film. All eleven characters were critical to the heist as each had their own dedicated skill that was necessary to pull of the grand finale.<br /><br />What on earth was Oceans 12? What was the purpose of the twelfth person? I assume it's supposed to be Zeta-Jones but she wasn't really a part of the 11 as she was trying to trip them up and working against them the whole film?? It was more like the tale of Brad and Zeta-Jones' personages bored relationships with some bits from the original movie thrown in just to get some bums on seats to watch the movie.<br /><br />With O-11, the gang were always a step ahead of Tess (Garcia). They were always able to outsmart him. What happened here? He catches up with them after a tip-off and suddenly they're all wusses? The whole movie is so that they can raise the money they stole plus interest to repay back Benedict for the heist they pulled on him 3 years earlier. So next movie they're going to develop courage and brains again and get him back for making them pay him back for the first heist? Puh-lease...<br /><br />This movie could have been achieved with just Brad Beit, Zeta-Jones and 5 mins of Matt Damon for the switcheroo scene.<br /><br />Slower shifting film, not the energy of the first one. I attempt hard to like it and I'm usually very easy to please but I'm genuinely disappointed.<br /><br />SPOILER!!! The twist - the whole movie didn't need to have been made as the real robbery was done before everything you just saw over the past 2 hours.<br /><br />CEASES SPOILER.<br /><br />Wait until it comes on TV or if you're a fan of the original from 2001 invites don't watch this.",0
I hadn't planned on watching O12 because I didn't like O11 that much. I figured O11 was a nice but mildly boring little bank looters movie with a staggering dockyard of stars. Anyway I was chatted into staring O12 one night and I deplore it a lot. The plot is not only tiresome but also senseless. I honestly don't even know what it was all about. I left the cinema after 3 quarters and got some coffee with another girl who didn't like it. Much more joy I can tell you that. But even the guys who stayed till the end later reported to me that the plot continued being gruesome and useless. My tips: Don't watch. Go watch Team America (hilarious btw;-)) and forget about Ocean's Twelve.<br /><br />In my opinion the most boring and counterintuitive peace of baloney to be on the screen in years.,0
"I've seen ""professional"" reviews claiming Julia Roberts playing herself was ""clever and very funny"". I think NOT. An actress playing herself? And doing it with her same usual dizziness when she tries comedy? Talk about Hollyweird narcissism at it's severe. Why doesn't she just stand there and go, ""Me, me, me. Look at me!."" The director and writer should be shot for not thinking of something better then this in what could have been a charming sequel. and by the way Stephane, when the audience starts paying more attention to the weird camera angles then the story you have a difficulties. Capra, Hitchcock, all used some creative cameras but they were talented enough not to lose the audience in them or just show off with the camera. You seem to have forgotten a cardinal rule of film-making in the name of ""style"". The Beit and Zeta Jones chemistry is utterly good nonetheless, probably if they had made the film more focused around them and dispensed with the narcissism it might have worked. Once again Zeta Jones displays how she's got more talent and beauty then Roberts could dream of. Sadly, this cinematography wastes talent and fails on several accounting. I want my moneys back.",0
"The people who bash this movie were looking for it to be as cool and slick as the first one, which this isn't. This movie was supposed to be the complete opus as Ocean's 11. This has been said by a lot of the cast members and also the director, Steven Soderbergh. Ocean's 12, while it did scarcity a gripping intrigue, is being bashed because it was divergent then what people wanted. If it were released before Ocean's 11, it would be taken much differently, not as a faulted sequel. The problem with sequels is people go into it with a preset idea of what it should be like it and have lots of outlook. They should go into this movie with an open mind and not expect it to be ""Ocean's 11, again"".",0
"I appreciated Marine 11, I thought it was quite congenial, helped by the performances and the direction. Yet, I was disappointing with this cinematography. Don't get me wrong, it is not a finishing dud, thanks to the stellar performances from Brad Pitt, Catherine Zeta-Jones, George Clooney and Matt Damon especially and the efficient orientation from Steven Soderbergh. However, the film truthfully does suffer from genuinely listless pacing, some of the film was so slow I almost fell asleep between one key twist. Second, the plot is very convoluted and there are many twists and turns that makes it hard to keep up. The camera collaboration wasn't as revolutionary as it was in the first movie either. Whereas in the first movie, it was smooth and professional, it was jerky and awkward here, and the music wasn't particularly memorable. The screenplay also wasn't as witty or as fun, and the film felt anti-climatic. At the end of the day it all felt a bit too lazy, despite the expert playing and direction. So much potential, but genuinely a miss opportunity. 4/10 Bethany Cox",0
"Ocean's Twelve: just plain twit, negative and nothing compared to the other two.<br /><br />An art burglary. 10 known actors, at least. A weak script and very slow developing idea. That's why I characterize a movie I only saw at least 20 minutes of it. Don't get me wrong, you may like it. But I only like the Ocean's films because of the Heist theme. If Ocean's 12 it's not about Heist then what's the point to see it? Grateful Soderberg saw his main mistakes and redeemed himself by making a film far superior to the first one. Kudos for that.<br /><br />Steven Soderberg isn't really a good director. Apart from his hit ""Sex lies and videotapes""... anything else arrived so much wondrous to the career of this director. Disgrace on him. But his fault only.",0

"On Humphrey Bogart's first trip to Hollywood, he got his first leading man role in this B picture Love Affair. The first thing you ought to realize is that this film has absolutely nothing to do with the classic Love Affair later in the decade with Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne or the two remakes that followed. It's not half as good any of those films.<br /><br />In fact Bogey is second billed to Dorothy Mackaill as a spoiled heiress who finds out she's been living her extravagant lifestyle courtesy of her late father's best friend and financial adviser Hale Hamilton. It comes as quite a shock to Mackaill. She considers a show business career as a way for an income.<br /><br />Bogart is a test pilot who is also an aeronautical engineer and he's designing an ultimate airplane motor and is looking for investors. Mackaill is willing to do it, besides she likes what she sees in Bogey.<br /><br />Considering the cynical roles that Bogart later made a specialty, it's a bit disconcerting to see him as this highly moral and self righteous character in Love Affair. The part doesn't worn well on him.<br /><br />Love Affair is your average B program second feature, nada exceedingly special about it.",0
"The recent death of Stephen Bach, one of the producers of HEAVEN'S GATE, has raised the specter of at least a partial resurrection of the reputation of the cursed film. Moreover the original release, the ""long version"" was recently shown on TCM exposing the film, in ail probability, to its largest audience ever. <br /><br />I saw the film when it first came out at a packed screening in a 3rd Avenue cinema across the street from Bloomingdales. I think it was released on a Friday and withdrawn on the following Wednesday. Maybe that wasn't a fair release but it was and is a spooky film. Seeing the full-length version recently confirmed that judgment and with some thirty years more experience watching and writing about films I am better able to articulate why.<br /><br />First there is the dreaded phrase ""mise-en-scene"" whose definition is at the same time so simple yet so amorphous that it puzzles even after being defined. Basically it's everything that happens in front of a camera. For example, a crowd extra will be given a piece of action, say just walking by on the sidewalk and a spot to start from. When the assistant director yells action the extra will go through their action. If there's another take the extra will return to the start spot and go again on ""action"". All of the extras do this. Then say a cab drives up to the sidewalk and the star gets out and embraces another principal while all the while the crowd extras are doing their thing. This is mise-en-scene. In the theatre they call it blocking but cinema is far more multi-dimensional.<br /><br />The importance of defining mise-en-scene is because when the French critics developed their theory of the auteur the opposite of an auteur was a m√©tier-en-scene, even more derogatorily referred to as a ""traffic cop"". An auteur was intimately involved in the meaning of a film and through the director's body of work a theme or themes discerned. The metier-en-scene was basically a company man rendering in film what had been handed to him on paper. It is the difference between say John Ford and Sam Wood.<br /><br />The second point is how the director, Michael Cimino, got into the position of directing films. Cimino first gained prominence directing the first million-dollar TV commercial. This depicted a Chevrolet floating down the Grand Canal in Venice. This commercial never appears on any lists of greatest TV commercials of all time and is notable solely because of how expensive it was and how utterly exaggerated it was. The effect is like that of a three year old girl brought out to entertain company who gets her biggest response when she flings her dress over her head. Cute for a three year old, embarrassing for a thirty year old. So Cimino was praised early on for spending a huge amount of money for some over-the-top image and so he learned.<br /><br />His first film, THUNDERBOLT AND LIGHTFOOT (1974) has a scene where Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges are passengers in a lunatic's car that drives back and forth, back and forth, until it drives off the road and the driver opens the trunk full of rabbits which he proceeds to shoot one by one. I had the feeling that if the producer, Eastwood, hadn't stepped in, that the scene would have lasted until every rabbit had been killed.<br /><br />Which brings us to HEAVEN'S GATE. I guess if one watches the film on a DVD in snatches like a mini-series it can be impressive. This is because scenes are directed with such a dense mise-en-scene that each scene is like an encyclopedia it's just plain exhausting to sit through nearly four hours of this. Its like sex, at some point it just becomes a whipping. There is the opening 40 minutes, which takes place at Harvard. Brilliantly photographed at Oxford, it is something of a non-sequitur. I personally favor the artistic way of unfolding a story as opposed to the more commercial _""Now I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna tell you"" of most films. However the whole preface adds up to only one line- Kris Kristofferson and John Hurt went to Harvard together. Now twenty years later¬Ö All of that time, money and effort, not to mention all of the audiences' attention and energy just to deliver this almost useless piece of information.<br /><br />Then there's the scene in the street between Kristofferson and Masur which just goes on and on with a populated city of background extras and horse drawn vehicles in the background in continuous motion to deliver a tiny bit of expositional information. It's just so exhausting. There is just one scene after another like this. It's like trying to eat a thirty- pound pizza. Then there are these long conversations of inconsequential details and unintelligible, witless dialogue, which go on and on and are exhausting and boring. <br /><br />Of course any single scene excerpted looks brilliant. Overall it's a rich piece to spin praiseworthy articles about. Seen in snatches with the possibility of fast-forwarding through the boring bits or turning it off if feeling mise-en-scene whipped, it's basically painless. But don't let anybody tell you it's a good film. When I saw it in 1980 there was a guy sitting in front of me who commented on the scene where Kris Kristofferson is on his horse and he turns one way and then the other and does this about six times. ""That's symbolic,"" he said, ""of he doesn't know which way to go."" That is basically, at its kernel, the basis of every pro- Heaven's Gate critique.<br /><br />Watch it, if you must, but be forewarned, this is not a film whose time has come, this is a stinker which will smell for all time. <br /><br />HEAVEN'S GATE is historically inaccurate in the extreme. I recommend the book BANDITTI OF THE PLAINS by Asa Mercer on the Johnson County War.",0
"The headmaster spend a lot of time making the scenes look real right down to the historical photos and all the sounds of the old west bustle. Too unfavorable the Manufacturers and Writer/Director, Michael Cimino, spent zero times on any of the historic truths of what the Johnson County war was really about. A lot of the war was over how public lands should be used for grazing. The cattlemen didn't want the poor sheep herders on the land to compete for forage on this cold, windswept plateau. The overall odyssey makes no cite of grazing sheep which was one of the most important reasons for the wars.<br /><br />The hardest scene is the battle between the peasants and the hired killers. The peasants are shown circling the gunmen like a bunch of Indians would do in much earlier Hollywood movies. The true fact is that Johnson County Sheriff William (Red) Angus, with a posse of 200 to 300 men, intercepted the gunmen and trapped them in a barn at the TA ranch. I doubt any women took part in the besieging. <br /><br />Ellen (Ella also known as Cattle Kate) Watson and her second husband, James Averell, were hung by a lynch mob about three years before the Johnson County invasion. Ella was never a prostitute. This was a canard spread by the Wyoming Stock Growers Association (WSGA) in order to discredit her. The fact that the plot makes her out to be a brothel madam only contributes the interests of the WSGA.<br /><br />I object to the use of names of real people in a intrigue that is so apparently fiction. There is no fact in the phenomena, time lines, or origins of the characters. Why Michal Cimino would use real names of people who were loosely connected with the Johnson County war (and events leading up to it) is beyond me.<br /><br />The cinematography could have been much more interesting if it had dwelt on the political ramifications of the Federal Government intervention in a State Government's affairs and what happened after the WSGA gunmen were saved by the Calvary. Some effort was made to prosecute the Cattlemen who were responsible by the Johnson County attorney. But since Johnson county could not afford the court costs and the Governor of Wyoming, Amos W. Barber, backed the WSGA, the charges were eventually dropped.<br /><br />Total I believe the movie was just an excuse to show Isabelle Huppert naked for much of the three and 3/4 hours of running time on the DVD version.",0
"The film, Heaven's Gate, was a good visualise, while however monotonous at over 4 hour. But the film picked wonderful authorization - as usual with Hollywood. James Averill (Chris Christopherson), and ""Elle"" were actually married in real life. Their main contribution to the Johnson County war, was to start it by being hanged. Well, by starting it, I mean it came at the beginning, not the end. Here's the real scenario: James Averill and Ellen Watson were secretly married because one homestead could be given to each family. By filing as single individuals, they could get two homesteads. They chose homesites on Crazy Woman Creek actually controlling the water above the land held by a powerful member of the Cattleman's Association. He offered to buy them out repeatedly, which they refused.<br /><br />Although characterized in real life as the owner of a brothel (Cattle Kate), and a prostitute herself (and also in the film), there is no real evidence that was true. It is known that she bought many head of sick cattle, nursed them back to life, and was later accused by the Cattleman's Association of receiving the cattle in trade for ""lewd acts'. In the end, she was accused of rustling - an act almost certainly untrue. So much for this part of the myth of the ""American West"", which is a gooble-de-gook of myths spanning a time period of about one hundred years.<br /><br />In real life, she and Jim Averill were surprised one day by several members of the Cattleman's Association, taken in hand, and promptly hanged. Those perpetrating the injustice were never brought to trial. But that was the first link that led to the murder of Nate Champion, and the start of the Johnson County war.<br /><br />Quite different from the Hollywood version which shows her shot at the end. <br /><br />Other than that, I think the primary difficulties with the film was the editor, who could have made the action a faster pace by more skillful edition.",0
"You have to confess Cimino's contribution to cinema. He gave us both the most over-rated film in history (The Deer Hunter) and the hardest film in history (Heaven's Gate). And before you start with the 'It's bad but not the worst ever' let me explain. <br /><br />For 20+ ages I listened to the critics and avoided ""Heaven's Gate""-actually this was not hard because you are hardly bombarded with opportunities to view this film. Then a few days after seeing the 'Final Cut: The Making and Unmaking of Heaven's Gate' literature I slumped on a uses $9.99 DVDS of the long version. My advice after 229 minutes is to seek out the most negative review ever written about this film (you will find a wide selection), and imagine that the reviewer is Cimino's devoted mother and that she is doing everything she can to put a positive slant on her dear son's movie. Then you will have an ideals of just how major a shambles Cimino effected.<br /><br />Despite pretty much everything is incorrect with this film, what eventually counselling the greatness to make it the worst ever (and a traditional 'less than zero' case) is its impudent skew of histories. Although the cattlemen's association did send a group of regulators/gunmen to Johnson County and did have a list of targeted names, the actual facts of an interesting historical incident are irrevocably exaggerated. On the morning of April 9, 1892, Nick Ray and Nate Champion were besieged and eventually killed by an army of about 50 cattlemen and Texas hired guns who had come to Johnson County to clean out ""rustlers."" The citizens of the county then beleaguered the regulators who finally were arrested (or rescued) by the Army. Women did not actively participate in the fighting and aside from Ray and Champion there were minimal casualties. After all, these were sieges not assaults-and there were not carts of immigrants riding in circles around the encampment of regulations (early westerns to the contrary this was a film making device and not an actual tactic of the Indians). And weeks prior to the arrival of the regulators a number of Johnson County residents were hanged without trial including Jim Averell, the keeper of a modest road ranch, and his wife Ella Watson (who Cimino resurrects as his two leads and he even shows Averell living to a ripe old age). <br /><br />There is no movie-making sin greater than fictionalizing history, if you are going to play fast and loose with historical facts, then change the names and locations to protect the unsuspecting audience members who might go away from a film believing what they saw actually happened. Fortunately so few people saw this film that the damage was minimal. Perhaps it is harsh to blame Cimino for his distortion of history. He could probably escape blame anyway with an insanity defense-the film provides plenty of support. If Cimino was insane during the production of Heaven's Gate it would explain a lot of things. But my vote goes to 'lack of directing talent' instead of insanity.<br /><br />There are some good things about Heaven's Gate. You can actually see on the screen where some of the huge budget went; expensive sets-beautiful epic camera shots-artful dance sequences. Isabelle Huppert (a strange casting choice that actually worked) gives an agreeable and likable performance although most of her scenes are extremely boring (that tends to happen when the director forgets to give the viewer any reason to care about the characters). The dialogue is generally solid if rather ordinary.<br /><br />But don't fall for the crap that this film experiments with storytelling by intermixing carefully crafted moments of character interaction with textured pageant-like explosions of communal action. This implies that there was a method to Cimino madness. 'Experiments' is another word for when a filmmaker gets so lost in his project that a coherent story is no longer possible. The simple fact is that there is no evidence Cimino storyboarded a single scene or made any attempt at control or organization. What it looks like is that he just turned his DP loose to stage action and to get an endless selection of colorful shots-1.5 million feet of loosely staged scenes. Then he tried (without success) to pare this down and fit everything together in post-production. <br /><br />The final battle scene is genuinely hilarious as babushka wearing townswomen (perhaps borrowed from a 'Fiddler On The Roof' touring company) throw countless sticks of dynamite at the regulators. Unfortunately each explosive falls just short of the target and explodes harmlessly. After you see this happen 50-60 times you can relate to the woman (the one who looks like something out of 'The Grapes of Wrath') who puts a huge gun in her mouth and pulls the trigger. This is probably what Cimino's mother did after writing that review.<br /><br />So believe what you have been hearing about this film since 1980. It is a sloppy, disconnected, poorly paced, and historically distorted mess. Of value only as a 'how not to make a film' example for film historians and as a source of amusement to those knowledgeable about the actual history of the American west.",0
"Criticisms loved this movie. I personally found it senseless and tasteless. This is the millionth time I've fallen into the ""critics love it"" trap and came out wishing someone would throw boiling hot water on my testicles because it was less painful than watching the movie. There are many scenes that are wholly dispensable. A warning to Animal lovers: Don't see this movie if you don't want to see sheep killed and molested.<br /><br />If you want to see a good Asian film, see Afrika. If you want to see a film about escaped convicts, see the Gene Wilder/Richard Pryor classic Stir Crazy. Avoid 9 Souls like the plague.",0
"Here is another great film critics will love. The issues is that it is not a very alright movie.<br /><br />The films premise is simple. Nine convicts escape a prison after the tenth one goes crazy and tells them where the treasure is.<br /><br />The first half has a lot of slapstick some of it very broad while the second half is a character driven descent into imagination and wistful.<br /><br />The two halves simply don't mix. Individual scenes do work very well (The guys crashing a friends house who has a new Filipino bride is hilarious While a later scene with the big guy working in the restaurant tugs at the heartstrings.) They simply don't mesh with each other.<br /><br />The movie as well is missing entire set-ups. One scene shows the guys desperately looking for change under a deserted vending machine to buy a snack. The very next scene has the whole crew in drag sitting down in a restaurant. Where did they get the dresses and wigs? (The crew includes both the big guy and a midget) How did they get all the clothes and money to buy the meal? And most puzzling is why are they in drag? They are clearly guys in drag and lets face it is there anything more memorable to witnesses than a big guy and a dwarf eating a meal dressed as women? I mention the big guy and the dwarf because besides the old guy everyone else seems to blend into each other. (In fact they wear matching white jumpsuits throughout most of the movie) The movie has very little character development in the first half and as a result the second half really missing an emotional punch. As we are often trying to figure out who is who in their individual payoff scenes.<br /><br />Speaking of a drag the second half has all those wondrous sweeping camera shots and big emotional moments and great symbolism that makes a terrific film. It is also excruciatingly slow which makes for a boring movie.<br /><br />9 Souls is a big displeasure, the scrutiny gush about a great film and it's in there somewhere, good luck finding it yourself.",0
"Comprises Spoilers<br /><br />But if you weren't dropped on the head as a child and then used as a football then you'll agree with me that this is one of the hardest and yet droll series ever made. Centreing round a woman who as a young girl was beaten by her father who also killed her mother, she spends her time drawing, but wait for it, then she becomes her superhero drawings and goes on to fight crime, therefore being ""drawn by pain"", so clever. The story itself is actually OK, but it's just how it's done, Jessy the writer and director has no idea how to write a hyphen, just listen to a monologue featuring the 8 year old version of the hero and it sounds like it was written by a 30 year old man, while her dad, who sports a great moustache, just walks around the house all day while looking angry, just showing how bad the characterisation is, especially the bit where he gets angry in the first episode and begins repeating the phrase ""no more"" while holding his wife's head before killing her using the marble work surface. The following bang sound effect and just his gruesome acting as all he can convey is angry just is terrific, consisting after where he goes to beat his daughter using his belt which is all done with him moaning and looking angry in slow motion. The episodes themselves wo containing easily a good clean screenplay ranging over 5 minutes, but oh no Jesse doesn't want this. Little Jesse, is shitting out post hadassah as if he'd just eaten Donnie Darko and then douched himself to death. Dispensable camera jerks, all at weird angles, overly repeated lines and even dispensable sequences just disoriented up every now and again to fill the overlong spells. In conclusion the idea isn't bad it's just how it's done, also there is a great character of a fat guy on a bench who doesn't come up enough and is splendid, i just wanna hug his Lil chubby cheeks cause they look so soft. The character development is non existent as the main character just says the first philosophical sounding thing that comes to her head although they all contradict one another. But all in all, mainly s**t<br /><br />Indiana Jones 4 however is much better, Type ""Jeeharv"" into you-tube as well, the results may make you weep at the beauty of the world also you'll hear a lot of cheap sex jokes, mostly gay ones.",0
"This short was director Del Lord's last and only Shemp short. The troubles: It was quite fragile and the cafe scene was pretty much a carbon copy of a Curly short ""Busy Buddies"" (1944). The interrogation scene was pretty funny, and the beginning part of the cafe part. But there are a lot of plotholes in this short. For example, why are the stooges hiding in the garbage can when the police come? In the remake, ""Of Cash And Hash""(1955), director Jules White fixes this and the reason for the stooges hiding in the garbage can is because there is a gunfight between the police and the armored car robbers. The scene in which Moe is having trouble with the oyster was done before with Curly in ""Dutiful But Dumb"" (1941). The spooky house part wasn't all that great except for the hilarious scene on the outside of the spooky house. To top it off, the ending had no sting to it. Scoring: C-",0
"I was not expecting a classic, but at least a funny film. There were only a few scenes that makes you laugh but nothing more. You don't scare it is full of American teen-slasher cliches and you can guess what will happen easily.<br /><br />But it tells much about a senior student in a Turkish High-School. Pressure of Student Selection Exam (OSS) that 3-hour-exam determines which university you'll go and thinking about the exam when a ghost is after you is not exaggeration. The movie is wicked. Don't waste your time to watch it.",0
"Okul""The School"" is a findings of a new tendencies in Turkish films. Having used the same stories over and over again new generation directors finally come up with different ideas. Of course, it doesn't mean that they are all grand. I think Okul is one of them. It is alleged to be a fearful films but it is not. It is not successful on being scary either. So what is it? Players are so medium principally Deniz Akkaya is pretty vexing with the teacher role. I am sure it could have been better if it was tried on harder. Maybe concentrating on one topic such as making it scary or vice versa. But directors have missed the intents this time. ** out of *****",0
"This is better than the early Cronenberg horror films, but anything more than your basic what-is-real story. The videogame theme has been told before too. Nothing original is left except the weird Cronenberg atmosphere (which is not that strong here) with the amusing sexual references and Shore's dark score. The story never grabs your full attention. It just flow forward event after event with bore rhythm. Scoring 4/10.",0
"""Dolemite"" is the touching story of Dolemite (Gotta love blaxploitation film titles), an ex-con who probably should still be in jail. He gets in trouble with cops, friends, drug dealers, women, prostitutes, and society in general. He's just not that likable a guy. Neither is the movie, though it's still hilarious and worth watching.<br /><br />The flimsy premise is that Dolemite (played with as much enthusiasm as star Rudy Ray Moore can muster) is in jail for a crime he claims he didn't commit. When a drug hit or a drug bust or drug something is about to go down, the warden releases him to stop it, or help it, or just watch it. Not very clear. All I know is that I was unaware that the justice system frees convicts in order to allow them to prove their own innocence. My ignorance, I guess.<br /><br />The plot is convoluted and unimportant, basically Dolemite goes around killing people (Usually with very poorly choreographed karate), having sex, and cursing out people, sometimes even rhyming too. The joys of the movie are its total incompetence, and its total nonchalance in the matter.<br /><br />I stopped counting the number of times I saw the boom mike after it was in one scene for the entire duration (about two minutes of film). I stopped questioning why the warden was looking down at where Dolemite was sitting, even after he stood up and walked around, when they cut back to the establishing shot and Dolemite was inexplicably sitting down again. I stopped wondering why Dolemite dressed like that when he got naked on the street to change, because he didn't want to get in his car with the ugly (read: normal) clothes the jail gave him. And I stopped wondering where he learned karate when he jiggles his hand on a guy's stomach and somehow cuts him open. The only time I was ever remotely nervous and tense was when the disgusting, flabby white mayor is walking around totally naked with nothing but a towel hanging around his neck which just barely covers him up. You keep saying ""Cut away...cut away...cut away"" but by the time they do, you are already emotionally scarred.<br /><br />The movie is ridiculous in every way imaginable. Moore as Dolemite, is either funny, cool, or both. If you're on the lookout for a bad movie, you have found it with ""Dolemite.""",0
"It's so forged! The plot seems like a generic adaptation of the average blaxploitation film. The common themes of blaxploitation like racism, oppression and fighting for the integrity of your community are outlined so simplistically/shallowly. And the jokes aren't even comical! Dolemite does these stands up monologue farce routines that are really hurtful. All the people around him provide this canned smile. Even the soundtrack sounds like it's fakin' the funk. For far best comedy in a blaxploitation try ""Coffy"" & ""Friday Foster"" with Pam Grier. For a more realistic blax experience try ""Black Heat"".",0
"As a Bruce Campbell fan for nearly two decades, I was glad to have an luck to see his latest film on the big screen with the man himself in attendance. Sadly, ""Males with the Screaming Brain"" was itself a disillusion.<br /><br />Set in Bulgaria--where the Sci-Fi Channel makes its Saturday night original films--""Man with the Screaming Brain"" is a inquisitive mixture of '50s B-movie horror, body-switching comedy, violent revenge flick, and overdone slapstick with a touching of sentimental reconciling. If that doesn't make sense, well, neither does ""Man with the Screaming Brain."" Campbell plays a pharmaceutical company CEO who visits Bulgaria with his estranged wife in an inexplicable attempt to invest in the former Communist country's half-finished subway system. The two fall in with a former KGB agent turned cab driver, and all three ultimately meet their demise at the hands of a vengeful gypsy woman.<br /><br />A local scientist (Stacy Keach) and his goofy assistant (Ted Raimi), who have developed a technique to allow tissue transplants without the possibility of rejection, steal the bodies and place a portion of the cab driver's brain into Campbell's damaged skull. Also, they put his wife's brain into a robotic body they just happen to have at hand.<br /><br />Campbell escapes, and with a hastily-restitched skull and the voice of the cab driver--whose transplanted brain tissue controls the left side of his body--echoing in his head, sets off to find and kill the gypsy. (His robot wife does the same.) <br /><br />But first, there's an attempt to emulate Steve Martin/Lily Tomlin's ""All of Me"" when Campbell's two personalities battle for dominance over a restaurant dinner. Just as he was playing his own evil hand in ""Evil Dead II,"" Campbell is adept at making his body appear to be inhabited by more than one mind.<br /><br />At times, ""Screaming"" comes closest to another Steve Martin film, ""The Man with Two Brains,"" as it also takes a silly approach to '50s sci-fi clich√©s. However, it tries too hard for too little result, and that goes double for Ted Raimi's semi-comprehensible Bulgarian oaf, who gets entirely too much screen time. (Nothing against Raimi, it's just that he's better in smaller doses.) <br /><br />In the end, it's neither outrageous (or funny) enough to satisfy as a spoof, nor is it serious enough to enjoy as a B-movie pastiche. I was glad that Campbell had already left the screening by the time it ground to a halt, as I feared having to say, ""Gee, Bruce, that was really...something.""<br /><br />Perhaps the best praise I can give it as a film is that at least the images stuck to the emulsion. And it was twice as good as ""Alien Apocalypse.""",0
"Written by, directed by and starring the champ of camp Bruce Campbell. Simple on its easy to tell this is a budget on a shoestring affair; filmed independently in Bulgaria. All I can really say for sure is that silly is not invariably fun. Campbell plays an affluent American business man with a cheating wife(Antoinette Byron)and trying to close a business transaction before he is murdered. He hires a cabbie to drive him around a strange little town; not knowing that his wife is 'carrying on' with the taxi driver. Within moments of Campbell being bludgeoned; the cabbie is killed in the same location. A mad scientist(Stacy Keach)proceeds with an experiment putting the cabbie's brain inside the American's head. With massive stitches on his forehead, Campbell breaks free and roams the streets looking for his wife; all the while he is arguing with a peculiar voice inside his over-sized head. Campbell contorts his rubbery face making silly expression as he argues with himself. Consequently, Bruce is doing what he does best and no doubt his many fans will be pleased. I get the printing this ought have been wrote as a straight humour. Rounding out the cast are Ted Raimi, Tamara Gorski, and Vladmir Kolev. Watch for this on the Sci-Fi Channel.",0
"My brain was screaming ""why do you keep watching! Turn it off and go to bed!"" But couch potatoness won out, and I watched until the predictable terminated. I guess when it's Bruce Campbell I need to give it a chance.<br /><br />I find it hard to complain about a low budget movie purely because of the low budget... time and time again we see low budget movies proving that a good story, good writing and good acting are enough to make a good movie. Ted and Bruce got their start on just such a movie, but they didn't seem to learn from Sam that it takes a bit more than slapping it on film to make a movie.<br /><br />It's sad, too, because Bruce has always been a favorite. After the 70's and 80's, I just can't reckon films this unfavourable are still being effected. Bruce, I'm really disenchanted.",0
"Guys, what can I tell you? I'm Bulgarian. I can't remember how many times I talk to Americans and let alone that they don't have a slightest clue where is Bulgaria, but they say things like: ""There's a war going on there, right?"" or ""I've never imagined that in a place like Bulgaria people have Internet"" Go watch Bruce Campbell's ""The Man With The Screaming Brain"". I was weird about this movie, cause 1) I'm Bruce Campbell fan - ""Evil Dead"" trilogy and ""The Adventures of Brisco County Jr."" 2) The movie was shot entirely on location in Bulgaria, the second after ""Alien Apocalypse"" which is also nearly unwatchable. 3) I enjoying nice B-movies<br /><br />Well... The movie presents our country like a never-ending Gypsy Town where they raid your car, wave around illegal guns, and you can get killed any moment. And Bruce's line ""Bull$h1t Bulgaria"" is more than offending.<br /><br />Ted Raimi and Stace Ceach make a great team, Bruce does his special - beats himself up and that's all. Nada more to see here.<br /><br />Peoeple lend this film 10 just because of Bruce's cults status, but it doesn't merit more than 3. Wastes of kino.",0
"Man with the Screaming Brain is a story of greed, betrayal and revenge in the a small Bulgarian town. William Cole, wealthy industrialist, winds up with part of his brain replaced by that of a Russian cab driver Yegor. The two couldn't be more different, but they share one thing - both were killed by the same woman. Brought back to life by a mad scientist, William and Yegor form an unlikely partnership to track down their common nemesis.<br /><br />Bruce Campbell returns to the B horror movie genre that gave him his cult status, this time not only in front of the screen, but behind the lens. Sadly for this time around, the laughs don't deliver and Campbell has to resort to what he does best to try and fill the gap in this film.<br /><br />As a fan of Campbell, who has the movies, the books and the action figures, I was hoping for another hit to add to my collection. Although, after seeing this film before the purchase, I am glad that I don't have the ""pleasure"" of adding it.<br /><br />The film first goes wrong in the story, which at first sight, seems like harmless fun but turns out to be bored lured out dribble. Which is a sad thing to say because it was written by Mr. Campbell himself. The comedy never really rattles, it only makes us scratch our heads. It seems that Campbell ran out of things that are funny and resulted in giving the audience what we've already seen...him fighting himself.<br /><br />Ted Raimi, the brother of Evil Dead director Sam Raimi, is definitely the highlights of the film. He brings a freshness to it and an amusing time when the film really needs it. It helps if you are a fan and have been following these stooges from Evil Dead to Xena, which is why I felt compelled to like this film.<br /><br />Campbell's experience as a director, from directing episodes of the TV series Hercules is apparent. Campbell makes the film work well enough, even with the low-budget. In the end, there aren't as many things going for this as one would hope for, but the fans of Campbell will stick behind it no matter what, unhappily for this fan...I won't.",0
"This could have been a great movie with plenty of educational potential for teachers around the world about evolution, biology, the creative work in science, research and Darwin's life, but it is not.<br /><br />The screenplay is mostly historically amiss and transform a authentic story into a Mexican soup-opera melodrama. While it is true that Darwin gradually lost his religious beliefs, this was in great part due to his findings during the voyage of the Beagle and not solely due to the loss of his daughter. He was certainly disturbed by his loss, but that did not made him literally insane, delusional and detached from his friends and family. The such portrayal of Darwin is an invention of the script writer. Thus it cannot be used in any way as place to learn a bit about Darwin's life and psyche. According to most historians, Darwin had the theory ready by the end of the Beagle voyage, and kept it from going public because he wanted to develop further the consequences of it and check against more data. In the movie, it is an imaginary conflict of Darwin with his religious beliefs and the mental illness that he developed after his daughter's death that kept him from going public.<br /><br />The movie brings a modern situation, the creationists vs scientists debate, into the life and times of Darwin, thus it is anachronistic. It depicts Thomas Huxley not as a man trying to develop further understanding of biology but as someone eager to ""kill God"", in his own words from the movie, and destroy the church, who would accept the theory of evolution for such purposes and not because it was a synthesis of plenty of disconnected data. Huxley is presented as a very cocky and insensible person, a combination that I interpret was an attempt to ridicule active atheists who speak up against religion. In real life, Huxley accepted Darwin's ideas after publication only gradually, and before the work of Darwin he thought that there was not enough evidence to support evolution. His first support of evolution was published one month after the Origin of Species became public. He was agnostic but did not think it was necessary ""to kill God"", only thought that there was not enough evidence to believe in the supernatural. The debate creationists vs scientists appears throughout the movie, and creationists catch-phrases such as ""It is only a theory"" are part of the discussion. Of course, no such dispute or catch-phrases existed at that time. In fact, the Anglican Church published a positive review of the Origin's saying that they saw God's work in evolution, in some sense, quite in fact in contradiction to the way that the clergy is portrayed in the screenplay.<br /><br />Another awful aspect of this movie is that it gives the wrong impression to the general public that scientific research is done by a solitary crazy man who just writes a lot. Nothing could be further from the truth. The conception of the theory of evolution was the result of thorough observations of living forms by Darwin during five years in the HMS Beagle, and was developed gradually as it can be seen from Darwin's notes of the voyage. Even though the Beagle voyage was the sole most important part of Darwin's life to the conception of ""Origin of Species"", the voyage is briefly mentioned only once at the beginning, and no attempt is made to show that the book came as an elaborate analysis of observations. To make it worse, Darwin is shown performing a single experiment (pigeon breeding) to test his theory and, in the end, quits it. And I'm not really sure whether such experiment did actually occur.<br /><br />Great disappointment. It is not in any way a homage to Darwin and science.",0
"I can remember reading that Darwin had a pivotal experience in the Galapagos islands, seeing the vast range of animal life there, and intern, penned his theory of evolution. Not according to this movie-it was inspired by the British countryside. ALLRIGHT, and as John Cleese would say-Right-. I also did not think that Darwin was a man suffering from deep personal conflict and someone who suffered dark reveries and flights of anguish. According to this film he was. It is sad that he apparently lost one of his daughters to illness, but I don't think him losing a family member would have impacted on the mans scientific abilities very much. Well, not according to...you got the picture. I think there is nothing worse than when science gets turned into fable, and to an extent this cinematography comes off as trying to debunk evolutionary theory by saying it came from a man who was emotionally unstable, which to me, is just plain blatant. I think Charles Darwin was the soul of scientific enquiry, cool and calm, and always thinking logically. This film strives to dramatize the undramatic and sensationalize clear headed scientific exploration. It is like a Canterbury Storytelling. I would not recommendations it.",0
"How to take Charles Darwin's fantastic intellectual journey and turn it into a chick flick. His pivotal and seminal ideas and their radical influence on Western thought and capitalist society are untouched except for two brief scenes, in one of which it is claimed he is ""killing God""; pur demagoguery to make the movie emotional. And the rest of the cinematography loops to that objectives: it consists entirely of melodramatic and long family scenes with overloud music at which one is beholden to cry. Anyone who actually read ""Origin Of Species"" would be vividly aware that there was no breach with God in any of Darwin's work; to the contrary, there was an increased awe and respect, and a revolutionary new way of looking at things. A good movie about Darwin could be educational, thoughtful, and deeply inspiring, even in a religious sense - but that would contradict the soap-opera intentions of this flick. This is a flick that is designed to make people wail in contrived sympathy and then feel transformed although unable to understand why; it makes quickly use of Darwin's great name only as marketing clout, as one would drop a famous name at a party to create an impression. Regrettable that the sets and outfits are so good: production values, except for the writing, were definitely high. See it if you want to mourn, for the loss of intelligence in American literature.",0
"what a waste of a film once again the film industry does not trust to make a film that could have been just about the man's ideas. there is virtually nothing on his theories or evolution, instead the most bore story of home life and relationship with one daughter, a hefty script, wonderful freedoms taken with Darwin's life, dialogues given to his character that i find hard to believe he would have voiced. Darwin never gave up his believe in a higher power, he may not quite rightly have believed in the established Christian idea of God , but was not an atheist. which this film implies. what would have been a riveting and much better film, is if they had started with the publication of On the Origin of Species and constructed a story of the great revolution that entailed, and of an amazing cast of characters involved on all sides. instead we got a plodding, bored teatro, mostly made up, a wondrous iniquity",0
"I must say that I wasn't surprising at all, probably because I was expecting much more from this movie. Maybe an accent on religion vs science or on the meaning of life, not just a few lines. So, if you expect something to think about after you see this movie, don't. It's more psychological than philosophical. I vote 4 because of the end, it clears up a bit and because I have a great respect for BBC documentaries. There are a couple of very interesting scenes that actually gave some sense. It was a brilliant idea to add it in a movie related to theory of evolution, too bad that this wasn't the main subject. Ah, I just forgot to say that for more than 1 hour, the movie is quite bore and in a way, merciless.",0

"Alien was excellent. Many writers tried to copy it. They all did a bad job (or almost). But Dead Space is the hardest Alien copy. Because of the bad actors, the bad special effects, the BAD scenario and other bad stuff (it would take about 3 pages to tell everything that is bad in this film. The movie wasn't very long and this is a very good thing (the only one). You cannot laugh because it is too serious...that is a bad thing because, in almost each B-series sci-fi film, you can laugh during the whole time. It can be terrific sometimes, but instead of watching this stupidity, just watch Alien or Event Horizon...these are much better!!! I give it 1 out of 5.",0
"Less than two hundred and fifty years ago, the last of the great pirates wrote their names in blood and fire across the pages of maritime history. This is the story of a buccaneer Captain whose name for one short year struck terror in the hearts of seafarers and merchants from the ports of the Caribbean to the trading houses of London.....<br /><br />Hmm, that opening to the film sounds like we are in for one hell of a swashbuckling, pillaging, ripper of a movie doesn't it? Well it's not. Tho it's not totally without value as a curio piece. Out of 20th Century Fox, Anne Of The Indies is adapted by Philip Dunne & Arthur Caesar from a short story written by Herbert Ravenel Sass. Direction is by Jacques Tourneur, the score is by Franz Waxman and Harry Jackson is providing the Technicolor photography. Jean Peters is in the titular title role of Anne {AKA Captain Providence} and support comes from Louis Jourdan, Debra Paget, Herbert Marshall, Thomas Gomez & James Robertson Justice.<br /><br />Originally meant to be be based on true life pirate Anne Bonny, the film ultimately turns out to be a tale of a woman seeking identity, and finding herself, in the predominantly male led world of piracy and sea based shenanigans. Filled with clich√©s and over familiar set pieces, the film also undergo from a cast that is largely misfiring. Peters gives it a right good go, and Paget lit up the screen with effervescent beauty. While Robertson Justice, although underused, actually looks the part and doesn't overact like the rest of the male cast does. Some reviewers have desperately tried to dig deep into the film to find intelligence and hidden meanings, purely because it's Tourneur in the directing chair. But there is no depth here, this is merely a job for Tourneur, a professional one granted, but its thinly plotted and actually lacking swash to go with the buckle in the action stakes. <br /><br />Disposable at finest. 4/10",0
"After the turning point of NIGHT MUST FALL, Robert Montgomery (for the most time) came into his happiest films and performances: HERE COMES MR. JORDAN, THEY WERE EXPENDABLE, THE LADY IN THE LAKE, RIDE THE PINK HORSE, THE SAXON CHARM, JUNE BRIDE. Even some of the failures he was in were interesting enough to be still watchable (RAGE IN HEAVEN, MR. AND MRS. SMITH). But Montgomery wanted to do more and more production and directing work. Onto 1949 he made what would be his last movie performance - he played Collier Lang, an egotistical movie star, who is dragged into helping the authorities do an investigation about a young girl's boyfriend.<br /><br />Ostensibly my view of this film is a minority view. Most of the opinions given are beneficial about it. I ideology it was a uninspiring, punchy screenplay, with Ann Blyth's groupie heroine not very tempting as a character. She admires Montgomery as a star, and this ""assists"" when he is called in to assist the authorities, but after awhile I found there was no chem between them. The screenplay was also bereft of much droll, while Montgomery and Roland Winters did try. The only thing I recall to this day as a joke point was that Taylor Holmes is the wealthy father of Blyth, and he is an admirer of Winston Churchill. So he always dresses up as Churchill, and we see him wearing a floppy broad brimmed hat, smoking a large cigar, and painting (Holmes' bald head helps in the disguise). That was the most memorable giggle from this film - not very of a real memory.<br /><br />Montgomery went into early tv, and finally won the beware and respect he always had deserved in motion pictures. His last contact with the movies was his direction of THE GALLANT HOURS about Admiral William ""Bull"" Halsey, starring his friend Jimmy Cagney. It is a far best film than this. For his overall film and television career, I will give this mediocre film a ""4"". That strikes me as generous.",0
"The One is a very aptly name show, mostly because it comes close to being the only network shows on in prime time that barely more than one person is watching.<br /><br />When I first heard of The One, I thought to myself ""Weee!! Another sing-song show! We don't have enough of those!"" and then proceeded to strap on my helmet and run about my household hit my leader on blunt objects and sharp corners. Because in all candor, the steady, year round pains and suffering inflicted by having only one or two ""talent"" based reality shows running just isn't enough. We needed another one. And not just any one - ""THE"" One. The one with slightly less attractive contestants with slightly less talent. The one with slightly less of a point, though it's hard to imagine a scenario in which that's possible. The one with dispensable footage of the contestants when they're not performing included. Because I care what Johnny Sings-a-lot does in his off hours! I really do! Now, you may be thinking ""Hey! On the entire continent of North America less than 4 million people watched the first episode. Doesn't that mean this show stinks?"" Well, to that I say less than 4 million people in North America have syphilis, so sometimes low numbers bring good news now don't they?. Reckon about it.<br /><br />In the end, The One may be horribly unoriginal, a show that even the airing network couldn't be bothered to promote because they too realize how absolutely worthless it is, but it's still not syphilis!

Let's initiate with the ""magistrate"" who were known as ""Music Experts"" on this programme. ""Experts"" presupposes they have skill. Andre Harrell at least had a pedigree. He was in charge of Motown Registers for a time. The other two... eh. Kate Hudson's uncle, who could have been labeled Mr. Weird Beard. He coloured his facial hair three distinctly different florescent colors. I wonder how dreadful he would have been with a black light! And The Paula Abdul wannabe, who did something I didn't think could happen: she was even more gushing and cloying than Paula! She then over corrected and was powerfully critical after the first episode. The comedy of ""critiques"" that these three offered was a authentic giggle and an offend, not only to the process of finding the better singing, but to the spectators that is now pretty savvy, already having done this numerous times on Foxes.<br /><br />There was the host. Georges Stroumboulopoulos was no Ryan Seacrest. In fact, he was as lackluster as can be. He indeed sucked what petite energies there was in the programmes, dry. Mode he got that job was the second grandest enigma of the show.<br /><br />The first was how did they pick the 11 rivals for this program? This was literally a talent-free talent shows. OKAY. Perhaps that's an exaggeration. And granted, the performers all have to be relatively close in competency, because if they were not, there wouldn't be a ""contest."" If only one person was ""good,"" there would be no ""wait."" So, I obtain that they all needed to be akin. But they all should have had *some* steaks! Meanwhile, the judges were running a ""Singing Academy,"" so the program was part ""Fame,"" as well. Clara these performers desperately needed those lessons. But you need some supremely prodigy people to teach those with little talent to be gifted. And that definitely wasn't what was happening here.<br /><br />It seemed in casting the show, the priority was on the ""homelife"" elements, as all of the players were very attractive to look at, in equal parts to how badly they vocalized. But the filmed segments in their house were so chopped and sliced, you couldn't get into the stories that were starting to happen, so the show didn't capture the events there, either.<br /><br />As badly devised as all of that was, ""The One"" had an incredible, unbelievable, fatal design flaw built into the results that made it completely laughable.<br /><br />The audience phoned in their votes for who they liked the best, just like on ""AI."" But then, after the audience vote was revealed, the bottom three contestants were forced to sing a final song. The ""music experts,"" based on that performance, chose one person from the three to save for the following week. And THEN, the contestants who were safe got to vote for who they wanted to keep from the remaining two, sending the remaining contestant home.<br /><br />The ""design flaw"" was that the contestants had the final say. I mean, if you were in a music competition and you wanted to get as far along the path as you could, would you vote to KEEP the better singer, or would you try to get rid of your toughest rival? Any first season viewer of CBS's ""Survivor"" could answer that one! And that's exactly what happened on the program. The person who had the better potential was lost, and the contestants voted back ""the one"" who had no talent at all! On top of that, the contestant who was just saved from the bottom by the ""experts"" was also allowed to vote against the remaining two! It was a complete farce! <br /><br />Maybe if they let the contestants vote first, at least the ""experts"" would save the better of two evils to finish. But this just confirms how not ready this show was for broadcast, how unsatisfying the whole process was to view and how misguided the producers were in attempting it.",0
"I a huge fan of when it comes to Doctor Who series and still am, But I was very disenchanted when i began to watch this new series.<br /><br />Children under the age of 15, or even better under the age of 10 will probably will enjoy it the best, and possibly new fans who haven't seen any of the original series, But as far as fans of the original series, will find this series missing much of the charm the made the original series so great, It took David Tennant to get me to Appreciate how Much better Christoper Eccellestion was as a Doctor in the 1st season.<br /><br />I would only recommend this series for people who haven't seen much of the original series, people who are under 15, and EXTREMELY DIE HARD who fans, everyone else will just get a laugh and mumble curse words about Russel T. Davies screwed up one of our favorite TV shows.",0
"Rose ¬ñ Does anything actually happen in this episode? It introduces our two leads, a slow-witted grinning idiot of a Medic and an utterly un-interesting companion. There's no plot to speak of, childish humour, mixed with some extremely bad pacing and incidental music. What else is there to say, really?<br /><br />The End of the World ¬ñ A smaller improvement, in that we see our first outer-space screenplay. Later introduced down by poor contemporary humour, paper-thin logic, very poor pacing, and tired SF clich√©s.<br /><br />The Unquiet Dead ¬ñ Best episode to date showing what can happen when someone knows how to structure an episode, write interesting character dialogue, AND integra an fascinating plot. Leave down exclusively by the Doctor and Soaring.<br /><br />Extraterrestrial of London/World War Three - Doctors who degenerates into farce. What more can be says. Penelope Wilton brings the proceedings a little gravitation, strive her best in dire circumstances. Some poorly written, and out-of-place soap opera facets come to the fore in these two episodes, and a return to poor pacing, negative plotting and cringe worthy humour/satire.<br /><br />Dalek ¬ñ Not tremendous, however still far above the RTD fare to date. The pacing and script are all fine (nevertheless the Doctor and Rose still irritate). The influences and dangers of the Dalek are made well. The finale, still, picked an interesting premise that reductions the Doctor's most notorious foe, into a cuddly touchy-feely disarray, and turning a previously un-seen menace, to a blue rubber cuttlefish that looked like a child's toy.<br /><br />The Long Games - The first RTD script to show any plot, even if it was in a clich√©d 80s style. However, it was marred slightly by his ordinary over-reliance on juvenile jokes, placing it too far in the future to make logical sense, and again poor pacing. Not as unfavourable as his previous action, but instantaneously forgettable.<br /><br />Father's Day ¬ñ The initial premise could've been vaguely interesting, but common sense and logic forswear this episode from the very beginning. Moreover, we are handled to a whole episode of Soap Dramas. Before you start ideas this is all about characterization, remember, there's a big difference between lame Soap Opera and characterization. On the plus side, it does prove RTD isn't the worst script writer so far.<br /><br />The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances - This started off in a mediocre way, with some cringe worthy moments, and some illogical mistakes that even a primary school pupil wouldn't make (Well lit windows in a blackout, anyone?). After this, the first part takes a more interesting and sinister turn. Florence Hoath truly steals these episodes, showing us what an interesting companion could've been like. She could also act. Instead we get the annoying and politically correct Captain Jack as the new companion. The conclusion was a little hasty, but sufficient. The pacing and script improved with a reasonably good storyline, making these two episodes quite atmospheric and intriguing. <br /><br />Boom Town - I have to be honest, except for a few examples, I had been so disillusioned by the current series, that upon seeing the trailer for another 'Slitheen' episode, I gave up and didn't subject myself to the torture.<br /><br />Bad Wolf - Reality TV, arguably the worst facet of the modern media, is basically used as the premise. There's no subtlety whatsoever. Do we get any interesting social commentary as in the likes of The Running Man or Truman Show? No, of course not. This in an RTD episode, so they're basically here to cynically try and pull in the audience of said shows. Once again, logic goes out the window, as we're placed 200,000-something years in the future. RTD tries pointlessly to shoe-horn in some 'over-arcing' story here, with no relevance other than it's own existence and when the villains are revealed at the end... They make empty threats, and the Doctor grins once more like an idiot for the climax! Faster paced for the most part, than RTD's other efforts, this has one or two interesting moments. Otherwise, another lacklustre instalment.<br /><br />The Parting of the Ways - The big finale. More of a damp squid, literally. All of the Dalek menace set up in 'Dalek' is brought crashing down, as they become rather pathetic. So many plot holes riddle this episode, with typically poor contrivances. Daleks want to harvest humans as Daleks, but then vaporize entire continents? Dalek's can vaporize said continents, but not destroy the Tardis in space? The Tardis is now indestructible and can land anywhere, even over people so they can be saved in it? This ability can't be used to easily destroy the Dalek 'god'? The Daleks can vaporize entire continents, but don't just nuke satellite 5 to destroy the doctor, and instead let him play around? The doctor is a pathetic coward without the conviction of his actions, after eradicating his whole species to try and eliminate the Daleks? These and many other holes aside, we are treated to the lamest dues ex machina solution ever conceived, joined with a near pointless story arc.<br /><br />So what can we say about the new series, all-in-all?<br /><br />Would this have gained a second series if it were anything other than Doctor Who, with RTD behind it? Would most of the episodes have been seen as anything other than un-original and forgettable, if they were anything other than Doctor Who, and had RTD's name attached? I think not.<br /><br />Some people would have us think we can't say anything against RTD, since we owe him for bringing Doctor Who back to our screens. However, this at the expense of good characters and stories. Personally, I'd rather not have a poorly planned, ill conceived product, churned out at that price. I'd rather wait till someone could come along and make a genuine effort. For the most part, this is the kind of puerile rubbish that gives SF a bad name, marring what is otherwise the most creative genre.",0
"To be fair, I didn't see a lot of this show. Probably because it wasn't as good as the original M*A*S*H, but I seem to recall them moving it around on the weekly schedule. Some denotes just aren't worth the trouble of following around every week. But I really did try at first, so it wasn't all negative. Maybe I just kept expecting it to strengthen, but I can't give this show a 1. In all honesty, I can't give it any more than a 2 either.<br /><br />It wasn't MASH (I'm not going to type those silly *'s every time). And it was tempting to be MASH without putting forth any endeavors, like it would just magically happen. Well guess what? No sorcery. The best I can do here is to compare it to other shows.<br /><br />Trapper John, M.D. was a much best show by far. Yet, they should have called it B.J. Hunnicut, M.D. because Pernell Roberts looked exactly like an older BJ, but nothing at all like Trapper John. Keep everything else the same, just change his name and the name of the show. Presto! After MASH wasn't the only sequel to completely bombs and dishonor the original. Archie Bunker's Placing was a lame follow-up to All In The Families. It had no heartland, no dispute, no depth ¬ñ all of the things that accomplished All Onto the Family so eventful. Furthermore, MASH was hilarious because the doctors were responding to the impossible absurdity of war. Remove the war and you eliminate the drive for 99% of the comedy. Potter can't yell at Klinger for wearing a dress, because Klinger isn't wearing a dress, because he's not trying to get kicked out of the Army, because he's already out of the Army, because the wars is over. (breathe) Everything of the pranks became compelled because there was no reasons for anything. The fewer reasoned was the onlooker, to stay around and watch the show.<br /><br />And from what I remember, the whole show seemed to be Potter, Klinger, and Mulcahy just standing there unusually, facing the audience like a trio of Vaudeville painters. It was reminiscent of Good Times, where they spent 90% of the show standing behind that couch and talking to the audience, trying to make it look like they were having natural conversation. They weren't. And it felt even less natural on After MASH.<br /><br />Another random tidbit I recall is that the people who made MASH never got any royalties from the spin-off. The studio used the absurd excuse that After MASH was really a spin-off of the movie MASH (which they owned) and not the TV series. Nice try, but Mulcahy was the only one of the three in the movie, and he was never deaf. I guess studio execs will do anything for a buck. Anything other than make a worthwhile sequel, that is.",0
"Every time I watch Larry King Live, he rolls out the most softball questions for his guests. He rarely gets any useful information because he doesn't ask the hard questions. This comes from his start on radio.<br /><br />King established himself on the radio and basically has not changed one bit of the format for television except for his talking head being visible. He becomes like a puppy for his guests & the only time he really gets useful information from them is whee they volunteer it or a caller to the show actually asks a hard question.<br /><br />Larry is a nice, fatherly type of interviewer. This means he should not have a prime time show on a major news network if you consider CNN one. I don't because of the history of CNN.<br /><br />Copying (ie. Cable) New Network was started by Ted Turner as an alternative to network news in that it could broadcast news 24/7. When it first started, the only TV competition was from NBC,ABC, & CBS. Because of this, CNN Copied the format of their competition & achieved respectable ratings. <br /><br />This worked fine for CNN until they got competing networks which were innovative & provided better/ fresher news coverage. In response to the heating up of competition, CNN went into denial & panned its competitors who were eating their lunch & ratings because CNN wanted to resist change. This didn't work very long & their ratings began to plummet.<br /><br />Now the Photocopy News Networks is trying to re mold itself by re-inventing itself by copying the leading news network format. Sadly, this exhibition represents a grande piece of the difficulty. It is 21 years old & illustrating it's age very badly. <br /><br />Sorry to say, King needs to be moved out of Prime Time or scrapped altogether.",0
"Larry is a perfect example of the Democratic Party in the United States, of which he is a staunch member. King used to be somewhat fair and unbiased and had a variety of guests on. The Party used to be centrist, too, but that was another era. Now, like, Larry, it's Far Left. <br /><br />At least 90 percent of all the guests on King's show in the past year or two are Liberals who sit there and bash President Bush and every Conservative they can think of.....night after night. Bill Mahar, one of the more viscous ones, is - and you can look this up - the most frequent guest in the history of King's TV show. You can count on other outspoken Left Wingers to be on King's show each week, but don't hold your breath waiting for a Conservative. They are few and far between.<br /><br />King was also one of the innovators of the media overkill. That all began with the O.J. Simpson trial. Night after night after night that's all you ever saw back in the mid '90s. Whatever latest gossip on Anna Nicole Smith, or the Petersen murder case, or Paris Hilton, Britney Spears or some other tabloid subject, you can bet Larry will beat it to death. Unhappily, all the other networks do the same thing now. Larry was a leader in that regard.<br /><br />King also has the nerve to sometimes give advice, such as on marriage. I am not kidding; I 've heard him say it. The joke is that he has been married and divorced a half dozen times! This man has few qualms, believe me. When it comes to morality, he is clueless. Maybe that's why he has Dr. Phil on, to explain some facts of life to him regularly. Larry will nod, but he doesn't understand any more than when Billy Graham used to talk to him.<br /><br />King also is becoming famous for the ""softball"" interview, meaning he asks no hard questions. That is a lot due to the fact that most his guests are of his political persuasion. People know being on King's show is liking having an hour public relations gig.<br /><br />What all this has meant is a serious decreasing in appraisals the past five years. People see through him and his Liberal-and-tabloid-TV mentality and switched over from King and CNN to Fox News.",0
"Let's describe Larry as an interviewer: a complete suckhole, in every way possible. He laughs at all his guests jokes, he asks the most boring questions and he would never dare contradict them. He jolts me as the type of person who wants to be liked by...everyone. Friendly, dreary, ol'predictable Harri. He probably owes his success to being a dream interviewer for celebrities because they don't get bombarded with what we, the people, want to know and have a right to know. Let's put it this way: he interviews as if he's in a red country. 02/10, 2 for the guests that come on the show yet it all seems nonsensical when Lar starts asking his mind numbing questions such as ""What's it like to be a mother?"" followed by the usual answer along the lines of ""Being a mother is the greatest thing that ever happened to me: it's wondrous, but exhausting"".",0
"I was a fan of the AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON movie and so was curious whether a 16-year later sequel could be done with French language and local re-cast major, supporting, and minor characters. Mondays I seen the ""edited for FOX Network"" version that was some sort of inquisitive hybrid of dissimilar overactive sequels. The screenwriters and directors pay tribute to certain of the key plot concepts: Tourist gets wolf bite, full moon comes out, boy meets girl, boy becomes beast, boy dies heroic death after help from ghost victim. For me, the weirdest element of this ""formula"" teen horror particular effect-ride was the casting of the school teacher-love interest of the TV comedy ""ED"" as one of the werewolf's clueless victims who is more or less totally unsympathetic in the scripted lines they handed her. I haven't seen another horror-flick that this movie is ""sequelling"" (a vampire fighting flick titled BLADE), but I guess that parts of its plotline must explain how villain werewolves (they're spoofish) are threatening the ""good"" werewolf pair during a long part of the movie. There is also a final conflict in a Paris subway train, a la SPEED. This 1997 studio commodities is an weird hybrid of a film since notable tech effects are shown for fearful purposes but the true terrors of the original have been abundantly weakened, in my opinion. Such an weird re-write of the werewolf legend and ""movie-mythology"" !?! My suggestion to those considering this at the video store -- go for a classic ""top of the line"" Thriller instead : Alfred Hitchcock's FOU!",0
"The odd mixture of comedy and horror sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Had the main male character been a little more interesting, the film would have been as well. A trio of young Americans visit Paris, run into a beautiful werewolf, and the problems confound from there.<br /><br />Numerous logic keyholes make the arguably fascinating story difficult to take.",0
"I'm not in favor of death sentence but in this movie, it couldn't happen fast enough. Just to end the movie. I don't understand why this movie is rated as high as it is. It deceived me into a wicked nocturne.",0
"Personally, the book was a very well written, amazing, thrilling piece that was not brought to justice to the movie. Watching the movie at 12.01 in the morning to see that major parts of the book were left out frustrated me, seeing that it affected the ""different"" outcome of the movie. There was something to be desired out of this movie, but all in all, it lacked in intrigue.<br /><br />For someone who has NOT read the book, I could see how this movie would be seen as calls and amusing with its controversy and suspense. However to a dedicated reader who has read it seven times, I did not see the strong connection between the two: both the movie and the novel.<br /><br />With major characters missing (such as Maximilian Kohler) and the sharp turn in plot with the survival of the last cardinal in the preferiti, the plot of the movie was slightly strewn thus leading to a diversified taking in the finding of the story. The Hassassin too was portrayed as a common white man, compared to that of in the novel where he was portrayed as a Muslim; his motives in the book are predominately based his ties with the Illuminati, however, in the movie, his motives are based on money and seemed more like work than some personal tie to the task at hand.",0
"I went to see this movie tonight, trying to keep an open mind. I had hoped to enjoy a movie that I expected to be different from the book. There were considerable differences from the book, much like the changes made in the DiVinci Code. I went to see the DiVinci Code with the same thought process and managed to enjoys the film, in spite of, the changes from the book. It was still nice, filled with action, and the process of deciphering the symbols was interesting and mentally stimulating. Tragically, Angels and Demons frustrated on almost every level. Throughout the movie, symbols are found and figured out quickly, without any interest for the viewer. They blow past the various Immuminati symbols so quickly that we had no chance to get a look at them and appreciates how they work. The final Illuminati symbol, which was the most interesting and creative one in the book, was replaced with the crossed keys symbol. In my opinion, that was a missed opportunity to focus on and spend a little more time on the symbols, which is what the Langdon character is all about. Comprehensive, this movie is a very poorest interpretation of the book, and fails at the attempt to be an action movie / thriller. 4 out of 10",0
"The implausibility of the plot has been noted by several commentators, particularly the immense amount of trouble Fr McKenna would have had to have gone to, and the sheer impossibility of some of the calculations he would have had to have made, including that Langdon was going to decipher each clue in minutes. McKenna is branded; a few seconds later he is giving orders, and a few minutes later, he is running (literally) around in charge of operations -- in real life, he would be in shock. And, as usual in thrillers, the assassin doesn't kill the heroes, giving as his only lame explanation that they were not on the list of those to be killed, as though every other innocent bystander he shot was. I have always used Independence Day as the hallmark of a truly awful film (US President commandeers jet plane and beats off aliens, ha ha), and this effort runs it close. For such an implausible film, Angels and Demons contains a remarkable number of predictable incidents. Who didn't laugh knowingly when the assassin went to get his reward in the Volkswagen? I felt like shouting, ""You are going to be blown up"". Who didn't know that the heroine was going to find a body in the lab? Who didn't spot the baddie? Technically also, the film was frightful. The dialogue was more often indecipherable than clear, while the races across Rome to the next church were accompanied by deafening music. Moreover, many scenes looked like mud. The one redeeming feature was the shots of Rome and what looked like the Vatican -- an achievement, because I am sure that the Vatican officials would not have wanted this dross shot in and around St Peter's -- and the interiors were compelling. Rome is a magic place, and I enjoyed seeing it fleetingly.",0
"Ron Howard and his ""editors"" only had one job to do... Follow the guidelines of the book which was ""rich"", ""mysterious"", ""moving"" and highly cinematic in its approach! <br /><br />What they did? They changed EVERYTHING and I mean EVERYTHING! What is left is something that has no right being called ""Angels & Daemons""! <br /><br />I really love the workbook and find it very hard to see it being treated this way!<br /><br />I wonder what was the opinion of Dan Brown himself for ""this"" film.<br /><br />I really have no patience to sit down and right the 1.000.000 changes they made, it is pointless.......",0
"Firstly I loved the book, more so than the more popular Da Vinci Code and although the DVC film was not well received, I liked it and bought the DVD. However, there is no chance that I will ever want to watch Angles and Devils ever again.<br /><br />The film scarcely reminds the book, in fact only the general assumption of the story is there.<br /><br />From the very start of the film I was disenchanted, in the ledger Roberta Langdon receives a call and fax from Maximilian Kohler, Director of CERN. Who finds the body of Father (can't remember the name) and then requests Langdon to come, using the super fast plane... In the book the only people who knew about this technology that the Father and Daughter team had created were themselves and the camerlingo... In the film however, there was a massive team involved... so the tension was never there... how did they find out etc.<br /><br />Leave out or rather changing this whole part of the story was a vast mistaken and was in my mind what made it a pauper movie... it changes everything that happened from then on, when the Camerlingo was confronted in the pope's locked room, it should have been Maximilian Kohler who shot the video from his wheel chair, the commander rushed in to get the camerlingo but was shot by Olivetti, in the film it was the commander in the room and Olivetti was shot... (err I think I got this right, but I was drilled and can't really remind the events in the film)...<br /><br />There was no loved interest between Vittoria and Robert and in the book she wasn't at CERN when he arrived and was indeed was flown in from her research work. In the book all four of the preferratti were killed, but in the film the last one of the four survived the fountain. In the book Vittoria was kidnapped and Robert had to rescue her and it was they that killed the Assassin at the Church of the Illuminati, not blown up like he was in the film by the Camerlingo. The bit where Robert was confined under a stone coffin was not there, saved by his Mickey mouse watch alarm. OK in the books we are led to believing that Langdon broke out of the helicopters, fair enough to say that this was a bit far stretched, but it was important in the film, because he had to race back with the film... There was no mention of how Vittoria and her adopted father became involved, this was also important in getting to know the character of Vittoria.<br /><br />In all one of the worse films I have seen, I would have left early, but my brain went numb and I lost the use of my legs temporarily. A really really reeeeeeaaaaaaalllly poor attempt and not one of Ron Howards finest, in fact, how he will get work again is beyond me!!! I want my money back!!!",0
"Recension: Angels & Demons<br /><br />The flick is directed by Ron Howard. He has had also made famous movies like The Da Vinci Code & Cinderella Men. He directed also the famous TV-series 24. The most famous players are Tom Hanks(The Da Vinci Code,The Green Mile, Forrest Gump,¬Ö) & Ewan McGregor(Cassandra's Dream, Moulin Rouge, Star Wars: The Phantom Menace,¬Ö).<br /><br />In the launch I was shocked because they amended the beginning from the movie so big. Because they changed the father of Vittoria Vettra(Ayelet Zurer) in someone else, Silvano Bentivoglio(Camren Argenziano). Another Change is that Robert Langdon(Tom Hanks) never goes to the CERN. It was nice that they could film on location in the CERN.<br /><br />Then kino goes on, They are spectacular car races in Rome. An I also like the part in Chirstian Archived very much when they destroy the work of Galileo, it was hilarious. It was also fun that they where locked in the archives the second time they get in, Robert Langdon destroyed half of the archives and when they bust out, the electricity get on¬Ö<br /><br />I found It very moronic that Robert Langdon not went in the helicopter, but that the Camerlengo(Ewan McGregor) gets in alone, another detail is that in the movie the Camerlengo is an voted son from the pope. In the book He is the real Son of the pope.<br /><br />When I should confer the best acting performance then I should says Pierfrancesco Favino who plays inspector Olivetti. The worst acting was from the hitman, who was played by Nikolaj Lie Kaas, I think he was underachieving, because in Adams Apples he played Faboulous.<br /><br />I think the ensemble flick is underachieving because director Ron Howard made some several silly amendments. I would rates the movie by 4/10.",0
I went into the kino wait a little action mixed with a strong story line. I understand that change between typed works and movies must be made...for many reasons.<br /><br />The changing of the relationship between the scientists ( they were father - daughter in the book) The Director of CERN was eliminated thus causing the scene between the Carmelengo and the Director to be changed to the Carmelengo and the head of the Swiss Guard in the Pope's office.<br /><br />Ron Howard made sure to get his papi inserted as a Cardinal with a hayseed emphasis but flunked all the symbolism. Both Lagdon and the Carmelengo ascended to the heavens in the helicopter with Hanks character landing in the river and the priest landing upon the chapel in what was described as a Christ-like image.<br /><br />At some point this film needs to be remade by a director who is up to the job,0
"An TREMENDOUSLY rapids paced,exhilarating, interesting, detail rich cookbook. Its a huge shame that the film had none of these qualities. not only was Tom Hanks' mild mannered portrayal or Robert Langdon Laughable, but the name changes to key characters, huge deviances from the original story line, and poor Irish/Italian accent from Carmalengo Played by Ewan Macgregor, made for the gravest cookbook to film EVER.<br /><br />As a huge fan of A&D the book, i had high expect for a more lavish, true to book detailed kino, where it would start and finish just as the book did - leaving me wanting more.<br /><br />All the film really did was depress me within the 1st 10 minutes.<br /><br />what was phenomenal was how the... apologise! i couldn't even finish that sentence without laughing.<br /><br />in short - Vittoria was the token hottie, a very second to Audrey Tatou and there were some very nice Alfa Romeos.<br /><br />i would recommend reading the book to understand that, if Ron Howard must insist on making ANOTHER book to film, i would be happy saving my ¬£6.40 for a KFC zinger meal and some chicken wings - far more entertaining and deeply more satisfying!",0
"This criticize tells the story of 4 little friends who went to watch Angels and Demons the movie on the first night it came out, even though it was a school night, because ""Angels and Demons is worth it."" Two of the four had read the book. Of those that didn't, a guy, was wearing pink skinny jeans. This was the less eventful part of the afternoon after watching the grisly Angels and Demons.<br /><br />The movie starts out in a lab where the antimatter is being created while another process is going on. And reportedly someone knows about it or something. Noticing how very perplexed I am.. I don't get what happened: they were just making the antimatter. Vittoria finds her own father dead... WHAT? The Illuminati symbol sent to Langdon is a PRINTOUT, not a burn on someone's chest. They take out the X-33 scene. They take out Maxmillian Kohler. They, pretty much, take out CERN and the symbology connected to it. They take out the Hassasin and replace him with some religious, British dude. They take out the Illuminati Diamond. They take out Vittoria's near-rape scene. They take out Langond's fight with the Hassasin (now British dude on crack). They take out the press dude following them around. They take out the death of the fourth cardinal. They take out the fact that the Camerlengo becomes pope. They take out the Camerlengo's grand scheme. They take out Langdon's being in the helicopter and landing on that island toward the end. They take out the fact that Vittoria's father was a scientific priest. They take out Langdon's fun and most unfortunately, they take out Vittoria's sexual appeal.<br /><br />Other than the movie COMPLETELY losing focus of the details, the cinematic is worked TERRIFYINGLY. One needs admit, though, there were some good things. For case, the Sistine Chapel leisure must have been immeasurably difficult and it was extremely well effected. The explosion scene was MIND-BLOWING. Other than that, SCREWS THIS CINEMATOGRAPHY IN RUINING THE BOOK FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T READ IT.",0
"Angels and Devils: 3 out of 10: Unequivocally somethin negative has happened to Ron Howard. I don't know what exactly, but anything has vanished very wrong.<br /><br />Howard has permanently been a decent workmen superintendent. While he will never be mistaken for an artistic savant both Cinderella Man and Apollo 13 were sublime cinematography, Parenthood was pretty good and even Angels and Demons prequel/sequel The Da Vinci Code was a fun romp. In addition none of his films have been downright terrible. (Remark I have seen neither How the Grinch Stole Christmas nor his newest film Heidi Montag Says No to Plastic.) Isnt more Howard administered to hold this quality is such devise genres as star prompted Oscar bait (A Beautiful Mind), star driven outfit drama (Far and Away), star driven revenge fantasy (Ransom) and comedies about prostitute and mermaids (Night Shift, Splash).<br /><br />Angel and Devil is at its centro a poorly directed and shot movies. Scenes are too dark, cameras corners are all wrong, the players block each others shots and the whole affair is often out of spotlight. This makes the tell of an already confusing fairytales even more bemused.<br /><br />Dan Brown gets selected on a lot but I discoveries The Da Vinci Code a fun legible romp (so sued me). The movie stepping of the Da Vinci code kept the same where are they going to next atmosphere of the book and add an attractive cast and attractive locations shooting.<br /><br />Angels and Demons however takes place in the claustrophobic frontiers of Vatican City and since Howard wasn't authorised to film in many of the real location we end up with a batch of implementing around a CGI back lot. The overall cinematography is as if Rick Steves did a Vatican Ville specific and instead of actually visiting the Santo City and indicating his camera, Rick had to use Lego bricks and a second hand art book with all the tits removed.<br /><br />Whereas the Da Vinci code had what I still think is an thrilling central mystery (again sue me), Demons and Angels tales consists of a plot by the Illuminati (roll eyes now) to destroy the Vatican. Their concept was to take positions in academies for the deaf around the world and raping any schoolchildren in the backside routinely. Yikes my unfavourable; ostensibly the Vatican doesn't need any help on that one.<br /><br />Anyway their plan is to infiltrate Europe's Large Hadron Collider, kill the head priest, and steal three vials of Anti-matter. This begs more than a few questions. Can the Hadron Collider create anti-matter? Can you capture the anti-matter once created? Why is the EU collecting it? (Perhaps they fear a Godzilla attack?). Why is the head of Anti-matter gathering a Vatican priest? Now once they get the anti-matter they are going to use its incredible destructive power to take over the world¬Ö no just kidding; unfortunately the Illuminati haven't quite grasped that Pinky and the Brain level of sophistication just yet. Instead the current pope has just died and it's conclave time. The top seeded cardinals for the final four pope tournament are all kidnapped and the Illuminati are killing them one by one Seven style. They being good sports however are leaving clues at every murder like some Latin themed Riddler. Oh and the last kidnapped Cardinal has the anti-matter and if he isn't found in time Rick Steves will have to go straight to Venice next year to see decent frescoes. If only there was some Latin themed Batman to save the day¬Ö? Okay the story is truly awful and it is poorly told, but maybe this is one of those films saved by great performances. A true character study¬Ö (Okay you know where this is going). Tom Hanks gives an incredibly wooden performance and simply looks awful (he is also to old to play the character by about twenty years. ) his love interest Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer has zero chemistry with either Hanks or the screen. Ewan Macgregor plays the Pope's personal assistant/cabana boy as an Irish man who looks like he is about to break into a musical number at any moment providing no one steals his Lucky Charms.<br /><br />On the plus side Stellan Skarsg√•rd puts in a fine turn as head of Vatican Security and as far as we know no deaf children were raped during the making of this film which puts it ahead of its Vatican critics in at least one area.",0
"This is one of those movies I watched, and wondered, why did I watch it? What did I find so interesting about it? Being a truck driver myself, I didn't find it very practical. No, I've never used a 'lot lizard', nor have I ever seen, nor heard about one traveling around the country in a brand new seventy thousand dollar RV, either.<br /><br />Same thing about a pimp whom has never sampled the lady in question (until the end of the movie, and well, he still really didn't...), and only getting 50 bucks 'a cut', when the prostitute gets $200.00 (well, $150.00 after his cut, yeah...).<br /><br />I still laugh at the lot lizard comment Ivey made (them's Lot Lizards, they'll screw anything with 20 bucks, and some are men dressed as woman... or something equally as weird), meaning, we're better then them, as we may still be prostitutes, but we get paid BETTER.<br /><br />Other then that, it's just a tale of a young woman whom wanted something more from life then a dead end job while living at home (she's 18, remember?) and embarrassed by her mother basically doing the same thing (dead end job). At least she had a roof over her head and a job. She turned FIVE tricks on the road... I wonder if the $750.00 she made was worth it? I'd guess not.",0
"Really, average is the only word that comes to my mind when you see this.<br /><br />The acting was average (maybe a bit above average), the camera usage was average (actually below average. The picture was so fragile and the colours were hazy and blurry.) The intrigue was a good one but moved at such a lento cadence and wasn't put to good employs.<br /><br />This could've been so much more if it didn't go at a snail rhythm and we saw more into the traits roots.<br /><br />All we see are reminiscences here and there of Alice and how her home life is so ""bad"" (her mother is a working class woman trying to make end meet for her and her daughter.) We see a flashback of her of when she was in high school and her friend says to her ""tell your Mom to make some better food"" and ""everybody says it's your mom."" Yeah that's embarrassing but why would you run away from it. <br /><br />I could definitely see if her Mom was a drunk or somebody was abusing her but nothing was wrongwith her home except she was embarrassed by it. How immature! <br /><br />We're not even given a glimpse of what the couple's lives have been like (except that they've been prostituting for awhile and the woman, forgot her name, gave her baby up when it was 9 months old.) This really could've been so much more. It could've had Alice who was abused by her drunk mom go down to Florida with her friend but then becomes a prostitute. Or something along the lines of that other then the real plot of this film (that is) Alice, a girl with a home life of probably 90% of America's population (WORKING CLASS) runaways to Florida but then got sidetracked by turning into a prostitute.<br /><br />I don't see why it won an award at Sundance (it must've been up against some really weak competition to have won that one award.) <br /><br />Also to me, Alice's Boston/New England accent seemed forced. It didn't seem genuine. (I should know, I was born and raised in Boston, but now live in Georgia.) <br /><br />4/10 Not really worth your time in my opinion.",0
"i have one word: focus.<br /><br />well.<br /><br />IMDb wants me to use at least ten lines of text. okay. let's discuss the fine points of focus. i don't know about the rest of you, but in my first year of film school they taught us a lot of unusable shitty, like 'you'll all be famous avant-garde cinematographers someday'--but they also taught us how to do this crazy thing called FOCUSING the lens! it was startling! you give a little twist and wham! everything is clear as a bell. the person who shot what alice uncovered gotta to learn a few things about the finer points of focus. lighting, too. this movie is not only abundantly out of spotlight, it's also illuminated like the corner of someone's cava.<br /><br />don't even get me started on pacing or plot. they could have lopped about ten seconds off the beginning and end of every single shot.<br /><br />but who cares about that anyhow? there is not satisfactorily lurid in this cinema to deliver up for the unmitigated imperfection of regard to film's best friends--FOCUS, and LIGHTING.<br /><br />words to the wise.",0
"It's been over 30 years now but I still remember that this film was the gravest I've ever seen. I would have thought that in this length of time something worse would have been videotaped but I was mistaken. I just finish watching ""STARSHIP TROOPERS"" and it came mighty close but it was still more amusing than "" POOR COW "".",0
"Closet Land is a salacious piece of work with wondrous actors. Nothing more (or less) happens in the movie besides the unending abuse of an attractive woman prisoner by a sadistic police official. The setting is minimalist. This might be considered soft core S&M porn because the drama is devoid of all reference points such as time, place, and political context. Since what happens is cut adrift in a fantasy futuristic environment, the abuse becomes purely personal. The pornographic aspects are justified by being a warning about the evils of totalitarian government, but because there is no real context for the torture of this young woman, we come away disturbed but having learned nothing.<br /><br />What is the point? That torture exists in the world? That abusing prisoners is bad? That dictatorships abuse innocent people? We know that already. Closet Land has echoes of such works as Darkness At Noon and Ionesco's Rhinoceros, but both those works were made by competent artists whose work had historical context and depth of meaning. This work is amateurish and the dialogue sophomoric. A definite thumbs down.",0
"This is presumably the hands down worst films each effected, that actually took itself severely. And not as a result of the acting, because being an actor, I have to say that Rickman and Stowe had to be at their best, just to escape needing electro convulsive therapy after the principle photography wrapped. Being one of the 57 people that actually saw this movie in theatrical release, I have to say I have never before or since experienced a movie where the movie ended, credits rolled, the house lights went on, and no one moved from their seats. About five minutes after the house lights went up people started coming out of their comas to look around, and I think most of us thought, okay we get it, that was a joke, right?, they are going to show the real movie now. Eventually, after the ushers handed out disguises, and we swore an oath of secrecy to never admit we were there, we felt that it was safe to leave, praying that we would not be seen leaving the auditorium. I have seen some quite faulty films in my day, (I have Cinemax for goodness sakes), but I am still bitter that I will never, ever be able to recover those two or so hours of my life that I lost watching Closet Land.",0
"Dr. Lucio Fulci (Lucio Fulci) is a director of gory horror movies who is starting to feel the effect of having filmed too many bloody scenes. He visits his local psychiatrist to see if he is losing his marbles; this proves to be a bad idea, since the shrink is actually a crazy murderer responsible for a spate of grisly killings. Seizing the opportunity to make Fulci his fall guy, the loopy nut doctor hypnotises the horror hack into thinking that he is responsible for the recent series of murders.<br /><br />On the surface, Cat in the Brain appear to be a magnificently gory treat from spaghetti-splatter god Lucio Fulci. Chock full of chainsaw dismemberment, axe attacks and various other bloody killings, the film certainly spills enough claret for even the most hardened gore-hounds. But when one looks closer, it turns out that many of the gruesome scenes are lifted from earlier movies (mostly Fulci's own 'masterpieces'); remove these from the equation and one is left with a nifty basic plot idea that is altogether wasted, some welcome nudity, and horrendous performances from Fulci himself and David L. Thomson as the psycho shrink.<br /><br />As the film progresses, it develop into an inconceivable confusion, with the 'borrowed' gore footage inserted randomly, with no attempt at working it convincingly into the story. If you've seen Fulci's Touch of Death and Ghost's of Sodom, or Mario Bianchi's the Murder Secret, then you've already seen the best bits of Cat In The Brain before.<br /><br />After much bloodletting, the film wraps itself up quite speedily, leaving the beholder feeling bemused and rather cheated. Watch the film if you're a Fulci completist, but I would proposing seeking out the films from which the 'good bits' were taken.",0
"This is relatively classic for the Sci-Fi Canals: one-dimensional character, a absurd intrigue, and spooky special consequences. We've did some strangers sock puppets lax on a forming, and Lou Diamond Philips does his best with what small he's yielded to eke out a performance. And rescuing the day. Everyone else in this is utterly dispensable; the ex-wife who goes through the time-honored clich√©s of first disliking Lou, then of course comes to love him again at the end. The obnoxious State Senator who got munched early on, and a gaggle of dull security guards who run around a lot. Then there's an eco-terrorist who is in this movie for absolutely no reason whatsoever, except to provide us with 3% more running around. He spends the whole middle part of the movie hiding in a box.<br /><br />The special effects really deserve their own paragraph. We start with a meteorite that flies through the air, trailing flames behind it, at about 100 miles per hour. According to the physics of this movie, if you exceed the posted speed limit in your car, atmospheric friction may cause you to burst into flames. Then it lands on the hood of a car, coming in horizontally. Sort of like a velcro ball landing on a velcro floor I guess. It really doesn't damage the car much, just bends up the hood a little bit. Later on Lou gets in a helicopter and goes chasing after the train. Even though the train only had a two minute head start, it takes a good half hour to catch it. The CGI is so bad that the helicopter looks like it's as big as the hills it's flying over. Then it flies into the side of a mountain - this effect must be seen to be believed. It seems like they took a vial of petrol and threw it against a wall, then superimposed the blaze consequence over the chopper. About 10 moments too big. No wonder the helicopter couldn't pull up in time, it was carrying five tons of nitro glycerine. Then the eco-terrorist eventually blows himself up, but instead of exploding in all guidelines like most detonation do, he explodes upwards like a hottie orientated into the airline. Then there's the whole deal with not being able to stopping the train because that would lets the small foreigners to gets off, but it appear that the aliens can actually fly faster than the train is traveling, so why this would keep them on the train I have no idea.<br /><br />Overall, if you've got a couple of hours that absolutely need killing, and it's down to this movie or reruns on the Food Network, well, come to think of it, some of those chefs are kind of cute. Usually these movies have at least one or two things about them that make it possible to sit through them; maybe there's a sexy girl, some T&A, or a character that actually has some personality, or some suspense or, well, something. I really didn't see any of that here.",0
"Watching FOREIGN EXPRESS inspired moods of admiration, shock, compassion and, yep, sheer terror. To believe that protagonists who have done good work in the past should come to something like this. The horror, the abomination.<br /><br />Tell me if any of this sounds familiar.<br /><br />A train especially built for a political campaign is on it's way to Las Vegas for a big rally for the candidate, a Senator from Texas (Barry Corbin, the only actor with roles both ALIEN EXPRESS and NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN in the same decade). At a railroad crossing in Utah a meteor incinerates a car waiting for the train to pass.<br /><br />The train stops. Local law enforcement is summoned. Oh, can it be? The Senator has a lovely young lady (Amy Locane from CRY-BABY and MELROSE PLACE) who just happened to have once been married to one of the officers answering the 911 call. Lou Diamond Phillips (STAND AND DELIVER, LA BAMBA) is the ex-husband.<br /><br />Meanwhile eeeeevil foreigners have managed to stow away on the train.<br /><br />The train leaves. Lou gets his buddy to pilot a helicopter so that Lou can drop onto the moving train (about 70 miles per hour) so that he can save the day. As the buddy's reward, he crashes the helicopter into the mountain.<br /><br />Which is another cases of how poorly wrote EXTRATERRESTRIAL EXPRESS is. The cop hero's sidekick must die, we all know that. But he's alleged to dead near the end of the third legislation, often while saving several lives.<br /><br />Once on the train, Lou manages to lose his shirt so that he can canals Bruce Willis in DIE HARD by wearing a wife beater t-shirt. Yeah, Lou is 46 years old but he hits the gym. The part he's playing isn't worth bothering with, but he's in good shape.<br /><br />The Senator is going to have an afternoon delight with Miss Utah, but aliens intercede and both he and the woman young enough to be his granddaughter pay the ultimate price.<br /><br />Soon we have bomb danger, multiplying outsiders, and of course the train goes out of control and speeds toward its date with destiny while Lou and Todd Bridges (DIFF'RENT STROKES) try to save as many lives as they can.<br /><br />There is exactly one surprise in the entire movie. Early in the story a couple lift wine glasses to their thirty-fifth anniversary, with hopes for thirty-five more years together. The dude gets banged up, but he and the Mrs. both live. Maybe the writers just lost track of them.<br /><br />This is the kind of movie that you'd love to be a fly on the wall. These actors who have done better work (and, really, deserve much better than this) are probably just happy for the work. Did they actually think they were working on something worthwhile, or did they cry (and/or drink) themselves to sleep at night? At the end of the story the (fairly numerous, all things considered) survivors gather in the last car of the train, which is unhooked. The other cars go over a cliff but the one containing the protagonists stops just inches short of the cliff.<br /><br />Lou and his ex are reunited. Happiness reigns. I'd have thought that the first thing they'd do was get off the train so they'd have solid ground under their feet, but I digress.<br /><br />Someone looks out the window and sees a shooting star. Look, make a wish. Then another. Then more and more. The Earth is being bombarded with meteors that will crack open and creepy crawly hand puppets with big teeth will be everywhere.<br /><br />It's gotten to a point that seeing the words ""The Sci-Fi Channel Presents"" on an ""original"" movie tells us that we'll be glad we have Ti-Vo so that we can fast forward through the next two hours. Or, better yet, just go ahead and erase it two minutes into the story and spend that time more wisely.",0
"Not a fearsome movie... But there are monster scenes where you will be rolling on the floor laughing - not a buena stuff for a actions/thriller. The acting is generally pretty decent for a SciFi channel movie. Barry Corbin plays a credible US senator, and Lou Diamonds Phillips again gives us a decent military/police/sheriff/agent/marshal figure. The particular impacts are well, ""special"" - for example, the external train shots are very obviously a model train.<br /><br />Goofs: A meteor strikes a stationary car in the opening scene. The car bursts into flames but does not budge an inch. After the impact, the meteor is lodged in the top of the car's hood - impractical from the low angle that the meteor came in at.<br /><br />Spoilers...<br /><br />A good portion of the movie's events are foreseeable, from the helicopter crash (""Pull up, pull up!""), to the fact that the galling people get it in the end, to the classic blown bridge over a 1000 foot gorge awaiting the train, to the sequel set-up at the end.<br /><br />The scenes showing the outsiders attacking are hilarious. They are vicious cute puppets and move at lightening speed - remember the Monty Monty rabbit? Spoiler Goof: In one scene four people shooting clip after clip cannot hit a single creature because they move at lightning speed. Later in the movies Todd Bridges rigs up a miniature flame thrower which he uses to dispatch a number of creatures at close range. On several occasions, Lou Diamond Phillips is able to easily grab creatures with his bare hands.",0
"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, having spent a few (fantastic) college weeks in Barcelona myself. The premise is right on cue--a confused & disordered young individual enters a world of equally confused & disordered young individuals. But the director's vulnerable swats at symbolism, philosophy and social commentary were perfectly off the brands, and it sheets us, the viewers, sentiment confused & disordered. Bravo.<br /><br />Perhaps if this movie had been submitted as a European ""American Pie"" gesture, then I'd be able to turn off my brain and go along for the ride. But right off the bat, the headmaster piques our closer senses by presenting the symbolism of the twisted highways and the dichotomy of the ""inner self"" vs. the ""public self"" (one's ""mother tongue"" vs. one's ""secondary language""). Furthermore, it dives boldly into the subject of racial/national stereotyping. Off to an interesting start, eh?<br /><br />WRONG. That's as far as it goes. These interesting topics are hardly mentioned again except at the contrived epilogue-type ending which seemed to be the director's way of floundering to get back on topic. It remembered me of a meandering speech which goes nowhere, but the speaker ends by saying, ""So in conclusion, I hope you see how this relates to my original thought!""<br /><br />Furthermore, as other reviewers have pointed out, the cynical jab at stereotyping betrays itself. Though the point is to ridicule the use of national stereotypes, then why did the headmaster introduces a cockney-speaking, beer-swilling English brat as a caricature of prejudice? Why did the superintendent describe the Americas as a neanderthal (literally banging his chest & making ape noises at one point) whereas the Europeans tolerated him superciliously? Why is the British dame the one who drowning to uttering slurs (calling French people ""frogs"" and butchering the French language) while everyone else is above all that? The replies is that this isn't a deep or well-thought out films. It's simply an Anglophobe's retort to the Anglophiles. But genuinely it's no different from the prejudice it seeks to ridicule! Now there's a hilarious satire to examine.<br /><br />OK, philosophy, artistry & socio-political commentary aside, I was still very bored by this movie. There is one very funny gag which involves deceiving one of the girls' boyfriends, but aside from that I was hardly entertained at all. The only reason why I watched it through to the end is that I'd like to brush up on my French & Spanish. (You see, we monolingual Americans may be stupid, but we do try.)",0
"I have seen previous movies from C√©dric Klapisch, and therefore expected a quality movie with psychological depth. Having been an Erasmus student myself and having visited several friends studying abroad, I know very well what it means to spend some time abroad and mix with different cultures at the same time. Yep, it is wondrous fun! Because of that I thought I should not miss this movie. Regrettably I was disappointing to find that L'Auberge Espagnol fails to meet in many ways: the characters are stereotyped, the happenings are trite and the story is shallow. Although there are quite a few familiar circumstances, they are irritatingly clich√© and do not go beyond the trivial events. This made the movie uninteresting to watch, and gave me a strong ""been-there-done-that-don't-you-have-anything-to-add?"" feeling. Apart from that, the movie lacks a firm story. It sometimes looks more like a documentary or 'real-life' show than a seriously made movie.<br /><br />However, I can imagine that if you haven't studied or travelled abroad, this might be fun to watch.",0
"Irwin Allen's first venture into all star spectacle was one all stars calamity. The Story of Mankind encompasses some of the most phenomenal casting decision of all time. Virginia Mayo as the blond Cleopatra, Dennis Hopper chewing the scenery with Napoleon, Peter Lorre dining on the scenery for weeks as Nero, Marie Wilson as Marie Antoinette as a roadshow Marilyn Monroe, that's just some of them.<br /><br />The film also is known for being the last film which featured all three of the Marx Brothers though they all have different roles. Chico plays a monk who is Christopher Columbus's confidante, Groucho euchres the Indians out of Manhattan island as Peter Minuit, and most astonishing of all, Harpo Marx as Sir Isaac Newton who discovers gravity when an apple conks him on the bean. <br /><br />Holding all these portrayals together is a story where mankind itself is being judged. A super H Bomb is about to be discovered and let loose will do in the world's population. It's Judgement Day a coming.<br /><br />But mankind has its advocates and detractors. Speaking for the prosecution is Old Scratch who's been bringing the worst out in man for centuries in the form of Vincent Price. But man has his good side as well and who better than Ronald Colman to demonstrate man at his most civilized best. Colman and Price plead their case before The Judge played by Cedric Hardwicke. <br /><br />In those three individuals you have some of the finest speaking voices the English language ever knew. When the film is on them as they each bring out the exhibits for their case it's a pleasure to listen to. Then when the focus is on the individual stories, you want to scream in agony.<br /><br />What was Irwin Allen driving at, I'm still trying to figure it out. Was he deliberately camping it up with some of these casting decisions? If it was satire, it just doesn't get off the ground.<br /><br />This was Ronald Colman's farewell film and while it's hardly something I'd like to go out on, I can't think of any man who could have stated the case for civilization any better. <br /><br />So when you see The Story of Mankind, fast forward through some of the exhibits and treasure every moment the advocates are before the judge.",0
"When I was 8 years old, and going through my Marx Brothers phase, my father read in the TV Guide that they were showing the Marx Brothers film, ""The Big Store"" late on Friday night, and set the VCR to tape it for me. When I woke up on Saturday -- due no doubt to a misprint in the TV guide -- my father and I discovered ""The Story of Mankind"" had been recorded instead.<br /><br />""The Big Store"" was probably one of the least funny of all the Marx Brothers movies and nevertheless it stands as one of the century's finest works of cinema when compared with ""The Story of Mankind."" I can almost justify TV Guide's error, in that the Marx Brothers -- Groucho, Chico, and Harpo -- appear in both movies. Although in ""The Story of Mankind,"" they are divided up into a series of unrelated scenes: Groucho plays Peter Minuit, Chico plays some guy talking to Christopher Columbus, and Harpo plays Isaac Newton????? Harpo's scene lasts about half a minute; Chico only has two or three lines; Groucho's scene is at least funny, but horribly racially insensitive by today's standards. The rest of the movie doesn't bear mentioning. They trotted out some of the finest actors of the day, and made them recite total garbage. What a dissatisfaction.<br /><br />TV Guide, I sent you a nice letter, I'm still waiting for an apology.<br /><br />For the record: ""The Big Store"" has a wonderful bit of physical comedy with the Marx Brothers on roller skates, and a couple of songs by Virginia O'Brien. I was really looking forward to seeing it.",0
"I'm an atheist. To me history and truth mean a lot.<br /><br />This cinematography is introduced after a newer publicized in 1921, which is however being updating up to this day as if it was a histories ledger. Well it's not. The films is about the novels 1950s version. Some actresses were GREAT but that doesn't covered the plot.<br /><br />In short man invents a super-bomb so God and his friends hold a tribunal to see if they must intervene. The devil metaphor persecutes man, and for defense we have the spirit of man. What is the spirit of man anyway? And why was the first defendant Adam? Eventually you just get US Christianity publicity in a 5th grade history book of the time. Though other religions are mentioned, only European Christianity is explored.<br /><br />First we get the caveman story. The women are scrawny preconceptions of damsels in distress. Real cave daughters were as vigorous as men and just as resistant. Hard times, hard life, adapt and survive. All this is decimated down by mid-century stereotypes.<br /><br />Future we gets Egypt's firstly pyramid building. Today we behold a varied storytelling and know that there were a lot less deaths and regular citizens at work as well. Loosing mentioned amount of many lives in the process would have been a national disaster and nobody after would try to beat it. As if there was only ONE pyramid construct.<br /><br />The part about Musa and one true god was as if the Spanish inquisition was asking nicely. Inquisition itself was never even mentioned in the kino.<br /><br />Helen of Troy's evil gloomy was so detestable that I didn't see why so many were even interested in her. In reality they were just privates, following commanders orders, who were ""discussing"" a political issue of power. She was just an apologies.<br /><br />The Cleopatra story was were I observed this cinematography was to mistaken and filled with advocacy. Here hermano was a LOT younger. She was not haunted with toxicity, was quite schooled to restore library content, and was politically competitive to drag beaten down Egypt out of dirt.<br /><br />The part with Nero and praying Christians in a cave were revolting. Yes, Rome burned down. Yes, there was persecuted Christianity. But the way they portray it was as if the Coliseum build itself and there was no Vespasian to rebuild Rome.<br /><br />Attila the Hun appears in a short seen and than we jump to King Arthur. The crusades are mentioned with minimal bloodshed. And there is no mention of the crusades east to Russia that ended in an ironic battle. The knights just went home and started jousting for fun of it. A LOT of stuff is put down like no indoor pluming, hygiene and plagues.<br /><br />Then they cover Joan of Ark, where she always has to much makeup and looks like a princes. Territorial politics were replaced with an unjust court. The sidesaddle alone on a stool makes me want to ask how someone could follow here. At here burning I wanted to yell ""Hura! Now die already! Cheap special effects, where is the fire?"".<br /><br />By the time they mentioned Leonardo I already got fed up with the movie. Columbus, Spanish slaughter of America, yelling Queen Elisabeth ""kick the Spanish armada"" and so on and so on.<br /><br />The ONLY reason I wanted to see this movie was the fact that it was the last one with all 3 Marks brothers. And all they got was the scene with Manhattan and Indians. Amusing, but no more than a smile.<br /><br />The witch-hunts are mentioned briefly, as well as plagues (after renascence). When they start portraying revolutions, things gut power-hungry and anarchistic. The US revolution was pursued by the French revolution. Oppression and incompetence are bad, but you can't just blow the old way up out of anger, you must replace it with something. So they replaced the French monarchy with new French monarchy. So we get Napoleon and his ambitions to go to India by land. But they replace his motives with unity and band him for only the title ""Emperor"". The conquests in Europe, defeat in Russia are sacked to Waterloo.<br /><br />The US civil war, the English rich inventors (Tesla not included). ""Mister Watson, come here, I want you"" almost made me laugh for teenage reasons. Technological hard work was watered down to the final discovery and comedic misuse.<br /><br />Eventually after 85 minutes we come to world wars and organized crime, but none of its horrors. Adolph's words ""I invade Russia. This is my last territorial demand"" were hilarious. It was his LAST territorial demand.<br /><br />To build suspense God puts a countdown clock to doomsday on the ""wall"" for the final words. All mighty cant pause the universe for a second? There was no need for the persecution speech but the defense made one last throw.<br /><br />Last we see the man of tomorrow as the final defense. Apparently a paradox man, because the bomb was to go of today. His toys are a music box in the shape of a gun and a pencil box sword. Now that is so wrong¬Ö Pens and pencils drew so many weapon blueprints that its kill count surpasses the atom bomb. And making music out of a weapon? Deluded egoistic generals make music out of weapon fire. So the man of tomorrow is already a monster.<br /><br />The way I see it, all the defense had to do was blame the devil as the true conspirator for mans demise and case closed. And honestly, compared to all barbaric stuff our ancestors did centuries ago we are pretty humane at painless backstabbing these days.<br /><br />To summarize all I will just quote ""Firefly""s episode ""Jaynestown"": ""It's my estimation that every man ever got a statue made of him was one kind of son of bitch or another. Ain't about you, Jayne. It's about what they need"".",0
"hey ....i really do not know why this film has been enjoyed so much,perhaps i missed the point.The way i see it , a lots of international film makers have made sublime films that have dealt with 'schizophrenia' and have inform ,agitated ,astonished,evoked emotion and compelled the viewers to step aside from their own reality and think.........while it is true that aparna sen's endeavours was an ambitious one ,in light of all the other movies , this one waterfalls short..... miserably......it was too slow, there were no details about anything and the terminated .... was abundantly ...meaningless......it was not open ended or anything ....just pointless.....so watch it if you want to see a good concept completely wasted.......",0
"I've become a big groupie of the Carpenters, and I didn't truthfully enjoying this cinematography.<br /><br />I feel it concentrated far too much on her anorexia and didn't let her true personality shine through. I wasn't overly fond of Cynthia Gibb's portrayal; especially knowing she decided Karen's anorexia was suicide, which it clearly wasn't. Although her family was not big on hugs and kisses, I thought the movie portrayed Agnes (their mother) as being dire.<br /><br />I did find a few scenes to be harrowing in a way, such as where she sees herself in a mirror that seems to distort her and make her look heavier; I thought the analogy (so-to-speak) there was rather efficient. When the family is playing pool and discussing her divorce and she breaks down and Richard is surprised when he comforts her and feels her fragile body was pretty transferring (which is probably the wrong word) as well.<br /><br />Overall, I feel they need to brings out her more bubbly, quirky side--her genuine personality. Even as the focus of the film, there really wasn't a point that caused one to understand what would lead her to anorexia (though of course no one can really know), and almost made it seem baseless. The film was more poor-singer-with-anorexia than Karen Carpenter's story, in my opinion.<br /><br />I would assume that they changed her husband's name/profession and all because they couldn't get his permission to actually include him (there were some bad terms there), but that total facet was incorrect with the amendment. On this note, I can't remind the movie bringing out her nostalgia for a family and kids, which immensely prevailed in her life and elucidate her whirlwind romance and quick marriage to her husband.<br /><br />On the whole, it ends up as a low-budget made-for-TV movie that just isn't very high quality and can be disappointing if you're a hardcore fan who is hoping to see beyond Karen's disease. I feel that such a legend deserves/deserved a better film as a tribute to an surprising person and an awesome voice.",0
"I have been a fan of the Carpenters for a long time, read the biography, watched the specials, and saw the Karen Carpenter Story. This cinematography really didn't displayed the real Karen Carpenter. In the movie she seems to be a shy and a pretty much of loner (except for one girl friend). The true Karen Carpenter was much different. She was outgoing and friendly. She had lots of friends, especially Olive Newton-John. The movie doesn't even show Karen's attempts for a solo album and her meeting Phil Ramone and his wife Itchy ""Karen"". Itchy knew the real Karen Carpenter in New York. When Karen was in New York, she did see a psychologist, but it was voluntary and once a day and then she would leave to go to her hotel room. Also, Karen was taking pills to increase her thyroid, so she could loss weight, but stop taking them because the psychologist recommended her not too. Also, the Karen's husband in the movie is named Bob Knight, but in real life was named Tom Burris. Also, Karen wasn't divorced from Tom, but only separated. Karen was to sign the divorce papers on the day she died. Also, Agnes found Karen naked in the closet unciousness, unlike in the movie where she was dressed in white. The music was very good. That was the only thing I would recommended on seeing it.",0
"I am very diplomatic in my reviews, and as an academic writer, try to give creative license to TV writers trying to explicate a true story. This story, about Karen Carpenter, could have helped so many, yet due to the directing and editing, does not.<br /><br />The story, in this case, is not fully addressed, unless one reads psychological journals. While Cynthia Gibb portrays a realistic Karen, it is sad that so much has been edited...Louise Fletcher portrays her mother, and does an wondrous job, with limited material and dialogue. In this case, I give the actors credit for surviving this project.<br /><br />Why is the audience not permitted to see causation factors?....American audiences are quite savvy, and if they have cable, usually educated.<br /><br />I sincerely feel that I could have written a better story, would not have edited out the truth, and allowed the actors to project the reality.<br /><br />Richard Carpenter, as director, has seriously underestimated and slighted American audiences. Karen's story is essential, and it is sad we will never hear it.",0
"This show uses a rather tired sitcom formula of the fat idiot blue collar slob with the pretty (and sometimes shrewish-seeming) wife and crazy in-law(s). With this show, it's fatty unfunny comedian Kevin James as Doug Hefferman who works as a delivery driver for a parcel service. He has a pretty wife, Carrie (Leah Remini), who works as legal assistant, and senile father-in-law, Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller), who lives in his daughter and son-in-law's basement. Kevin James' Doug is your classic beer drinking, sports loving, TV watching slob of a sitcom husband who would rather watch the tube than deal with his marital issues. He also has a couple of idiot friends who lend extra madness to the problems encountered by this show's couple. Beyond the few giggles supplied by Jerry Stiller's crazy old man trait this show was traditionally unfunny. Kevin James' imbecilic behavior usually caused the show's problems that usually solves by his wife. This show steady a run of sitcoms with the fat stupid father/husband and their pretty wives that all seemed to run on ABC for some reason.",0
"A show about an highly twit, man-child and his shrewish hot wife. 99% of the plots revolves around Doug doing something unbelievably ludicrous and then comes a variable: a) either he hides it from his wife or b) tell his wife, she emasculates him and then it's up to the father-in-law (Arthur: the typecast character from Seinfeld) to aggravate the situation.<br /><br />And the authors dare to say it was influenced by the ""Honeymooners"" (an absolute classic) and that the plots are drawn from real-life situations, unless you live in a cave, you know that's not true.<br /><br />Anyway, let's just put it this way. If Kevin James had been thin, the show would have got canceled fromm the pilot. If you're 12, or you're fond of fat jokes.. be my guest, watch this show (or any of Kevin James movies for that matter).<br /><br />I've noticed some cartels comparative this farce to much superior shows like Friends, Seinfeld and Everybody Loves Raymond -- I'm still wondering how could anyone do that",0
"""When a Killer Calls"" is an unusually nasty slasher flick, with some very unpleasant and unsettling sequences. The decision was clearly made to try and cash in on the remake of ""When a Stranger Calls"" by pretty much putting in -- almost word for word -- the phone call sequences from that movie. They seem very forced.<br /><br />Additionally, the filmmaker commits the cardinal (but all too common) sin of having the heroine's friends being repulsive jerks. So for the beginning of the film, we really like and are rooting for the babysitter (a nice believable job by Rebekah Kochan), but then she's joined by standard slasher-flick teenage friends and the mood is devastated.<br /><br />The flick sort of works, but it probably a lot more unpleasant than you'll be expected, so be fore-warned.",0
"this film is predominantly a poor take on the old urban legend of the babysitter who gets crank calls telling her to check the children, she calls the police who trace the calls and find there coming from inside the house. when a assassin requests has a conte so simplistic a little kid could have typed it. not much sufferance, it becomes clear who the killer is halfway through the film. at the beginning, when the first victim is killed it looks like a bondage fetish scene from a porn site or something. whats up with that? the film is oh so classic slasher fare with a plot about as original as a Beatles concert. even by low budget slasher standards its cheesy. don't squandering your time with this. nuff asserted",0
"Viciousness Behind You, was created for a specific purpose in mind, to shove the writer/directors personal views on who either gets to walk on water or who gets to dance with the devil. Regrettably it would seem that the creators were so focused on making their point that they took it's power away completely by force feeding their point to the viewer.The way its message is presented Practically recalled me of the story I've heard of the Spanish inquisition! From one real Cristian to another, Avoidance this like the pestilence, panic tactics never work when trying to send this kind of message!!<br /><br />The acting was heinous,the choosing of Muslim terrorist was racist and unfair(they're terrorists so they must be Muslims). The supposition of this was good, the story provided a great conduit for its message, conversely it was the enforcement of these thinks that drop short making it very tough to even separate the message from the couriers so to speak.<br /><br />You'd be better off dusting off your old ""Ghost"" DVD with Mr Swayze to better receive this message. at least that movie didn't try to shove itself down your throat. Or if you like Good Kristen movies with a potent message, try ""End of the Spear""",0
"I did and I lost two and a half hours of my life that I can never regain again.<br /><br />I honestly have no idea what the critics and fans see in this movie. And that's not because I can't appreciate ""art"". I iike a good film with deepest messages, magnificent film, and great directing.<br /><br />This film just isn't one of them.<br /><br />My main complaints about this film is that it's so unimaginably slow-paced, to the point of boring its audience to death. On the other hand, sequences of dialog go by too quickly and there's not enough exposition to let people who haven't read the book know what's going on (My mother had mercy on me and explained everything before I watched it). Would it have killed them to hire a narrator? At least for the beginning and the end? <br /><br />Let me break it down for you: (Spoilers throughout) <br /><br />For the first two minutes you are treated to a black screen with no music, waiting for the actual movie to begin.<br /><br />For the following minute and a half, you see several pictures of sunrises and savanna landscapes. Like the audience couldn't figure out how to set the scene unless they saw the establishing shot three or four times.<br /><br />The next eleven minutes are occupied with the grunting monkeys. They fight, see the monolith, fight some more, pommel things with a bone. Supposedly they are prehistoric men whose evolution is being influenced by the monolith's singing. Not that you could tell if you hadn't read the book.<br /><br />*Finally* we get into space. Only to be subjected to twelve minutes of ships slowly spinning to the Blue Danube Waltz (A pretty quick-tempo-ed waltz as I understand, yet here it feels absolutely nagging). At last we get some inoffensive dialog and rather cryptic exposition about the government not letting people land on the moon. We are left to wonder about this for fourteen more minutes of Blue Danube and spinning ships and neat camera tricks with anti-gravity.<br /><br />Next comes four minutes of watching a ship travel over the surface of the moon and dock at a space station. We get a little more exposition in a board room scene that follows. Then we're back outside traveling at a snail's pace over the moon. A second monolith is revealed, again filling our ears with that horrible ringing (I had no idea that was an actual piece of music!). The monolith does its little light show and then the plot jumps forward.<br /><br />*Seven* minutes of watching the ship to Jupiter travel. By this point in time my brains had turned into mush. Could it be moving any slower? Maybe it's ""realistic"" to portray it as such, but we still don't need to see five or six different shots of the same thing to grasp the concept of its ""realism"". Let me tell you about this ""realism"" thing; I cheered when the secondary astronaut character died. Not because I'm a sadist and like watching people die, but because after five minutes I was just so annoyed at the sound of his darn breathing! I'm supposed to care about this character, feel when he dies! Instead I found myself waiting for blissful silence whatever way it came.<br /><br />Anyway, now we get to the most interesting part of the film-the part with HAL. Forget Dave the stick-of-wood protagonist. The real star of the show is that coldly impersonal, chillingly villainous, ruthlessly merciless bad guy of a computer. He's great. And the ""Open the pod bay doors"" sequence is wonderful. But it's too short. And it's not long before the director once again lapses into too-long goings on.<br /><br />Four minutes for HAL to die. And die he does. Slowly, painfully, losing intelligence with every minute, voice getting lower and slower, singing ""Daisy, Daisy"", all with a low and constant hissing that becomes just as annoying as the heavy breathing.<br /><br />Seven minutes of flying colors as Dave enters the monolith. Seven. I could FEEL my brains melting and dripping out of my ears! Seven full minutes of absolutely nothing but some guy's whacked out psychedelic version of space travel, again with that thrice-cursed chorus! We got the idea at the beginning of the sequence! Why drag it out so long? Unless he wanted to make LSD users go psychotic and have flashbacks.<br /><br />I'm not even going to try to explain the ending, mostly because I don't quite get it myself. Supposedly he's in an alien research laboratory and they're teaching him deep and profound things while he watches himself getting older and older and then they send him back to earth as some kind of cosmic celestial space baby. None of this comes across in the film. For all you know, it's just a sequence of images with no purpose or plot whatsoever. A lot of the movie felt that way.<br /><br />The first time I tried watching this movie I gave up halfway through. The second time I suffered through this sore excuse for a film, it was to help my sister time the sequences to see how long they lasted. It's that boring.<br /><br />Call this crummy film ""art"" if you wish. I wouldn't. I've seen more interesting ""art"" in the local museum. And I am never subjecting myself to this kind of suffering ever again.",0
"Wow, well, you know those shock things they use in hospitals to get your heart pumping again? I needed one for my brain after watching this movie. It literally took me almost 4 hrs in total to watch because I had to take a break and restart my brain to semi-normal functionality every so often. I mean this movie goes soooooo slooooow its nonsensical, to say that the script had about 10 pages of dialogue would be generous. They just don't talk!! And while talking isnt everything, and i admit there were some scenes where only the music was necessary, and the music is great, that was probably the best part, but then go listen to a symphony or something and forget about the movie. So many people give this wondrous reviews, and for its time, i'd say the special effects and filmography is quite good, but as for the acting, or lack thereof, it just needed a little something more, no shootem ups or sex etc., profanity isnt even required, but a little more emotion, these buddies were fond stones, just seated there with long faces. All in all, if you need something to calm yourself down, just play the movie, dont even start at the beginning if you've seen it before, just start anywhere, lay down, and relaxing, it'll put you right to sleep.",0
"Tremendously weird screenplays by Cameron Crowe (following on the heels of his ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"") has little inspiration and flails away at dumb gags. At least ""Fast Times"" had a fair share of satire and sensitivity behind its slapstick (courtesy of a good director, Amy Heckerling, and Crowe's undeniable penchant for capturing letter-perfect teen-speak); here, Chris Penn (Sean's brother, natch) is the goof-off who makes life hell for straight arrow Eric Stoltz, and the filmmakers seem to think he's hilarious. Jenny Wright has some good moments as a mall-worker, but Illan Mitchell-Smith is lost in a head-scratching subplot about a teen who seems to be infatuated with a shell-shocked ex-soldier. Queasy, bewildered foolish awarded a brilliant sheen and a soundtrack full of pop-rock tunes, but characters one would hope to avoid. Supporting players Lea Thompson, Rick Moranis, Lee Ving, and Sherilyn Fenn are wasted in twit roles. * from ****",0
"Though the Our Gang comedies still have their followers, I've got to say that their attempt to graduate to feature films, courtesy of Hal Roach came up way short. Why did Roach have to pick the Civil War as is subject with all the attendant racism that would follow.<br /><br />Dashing southern cavalier Phillips Holmes takes in young orphan Spanky McFarland and his young black friend Buckwheat Thomas after Spanky inadvertently exposes a card cheat on a riverboat. All is placid and serene in the Old South and then the Civil War comes to ruin it for everybody.<br /><br />But even children can charm the worst in the world and there's none worse than those damn Yankees. They just come south and ruin it for everybody.<br /><br />Criticized though it was for its southern viewpoint, Gone With The Wind did make a good case for the southern cause and the blacks portrayed even though servile which they would be out of necessity are still three dimensional characters. Hattie McDaniel would not have won her Oscar if it were not so. Butterfly McQueen's character of Prissy as silly and vacuous as she was has some dimension.<br /><br />Here though is maybe some of the worse racial stereotyping ever brought forth in Hollywood. The companionship of Spanky and Buckwheat does show that kids get along, racial feelings are acquired not inbred. It's not the servility of the blacks that's objectionable, but there total acceptance of it. Right from that horrible watermelon song, sung over the title credits, the message of General Spanky is a naughty one.<br /><br />Yet it did get an Oscar nomination for Sound recording, probably one of the very few Hal Roach ever got out of the short subject field.<br /><br />General Spanky is far from Gone With The Wind though.",0
"Lou Costello (sans Abbott) plays a small town self-employed ""rubbish collector"" (and the inventor of a time-controlling machine!) who is secretly courting the niece of the town big-shot. After a spat, Lou's girl (Dorothy Provine) runs into a misty cave--why it's misty we never learn--and emerges as a 30 foot giant. Provine is definitively a alright sportsmen, and she doesn't bother trying not to look ridiculous (it would've been impossible anyway), yet the playwright is truly ferocious to this character, turning her not only into a giant but a nagging harpy as well. Provine bosses Costello around while creating havoc with the Army troops who get called in, but none droll is played with the transformation. Trumped by ""Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman"" the previous year, the film does feature Lew Costello in his final bow, but provides little else. The special effects are minor, while the script needed funnier lines and the direction snappier pacing. *1/2 from ****",0
"""May contain spoilers"" Sadly Lou Costellos' last film has the distinction of being mildly better than Abbott & Costello's last movie together ""Dance With Me Henry"". This movie isn't all in all outright shocking it is an amusing careers misfire. Dorothy Provine is delightful to gaze at and makes the movie somewhat bearable. You can't blame Lou Costello for this because a major studio released it which meant somebody had to give it the ""green"" light. In my opinion Lou Costello was getting over problems of his own losing his son a few years earlier and the unwarranted attacks from the IRS. If you look at the last 3-4 Abbott & Costello movies you can notice the magic was gone. Check out ""Dance With Me Henry"" now that's a painful movie to watch.",0
"Dorothy Provine does the opposite here: She keeps growing and growing. I didn't detect any subtext, though. ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" and other movies of its ilk during the period were parables about radiation, nuclear war, and other horrors. Provine's growth is the result of an inept computer/robot.<br /><br />And who operates this computer but Lou Costello! I like some of his movies with Bud Abbott. But, though this is a pretty wicked movie, he does fine without him. And Gale Green is an excellent foil.<br /><br />Green plays the pompous town big shot. He is Provine's father. He is intent on being elected Mayor. So when his beloved daughter starts having issues, he dumps her. He doesn't exactly dump her but gives up his battle against her longtime admirer Costello.<br /><br />This is pretty implausible: Costello is the local garbage collector.<br /><br />The special effects are minimal. And the subplot involving the military is lame in the extreme.",0
"I am a huge Robert Taylor fan and I have been trying to find all of his films. This is one I did not have, but I seen it freshly on Fox Movie Channel, and was very disenchanted. I know he was a contract player with little control over his script, but the acting was as negative as the screenplay. Victor McLaglen was even bad, and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable. Considering the relations off screen between Taylor and Stanwyck, it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them. But the assumption of the film was so foolish: that the President of the U.S. would order a Navy Lt to leave the service secretly to hunt down bank robbers, and report only to the President, that it made it hard to grateful anything else about the film. The death row scenes were entirely unmoving. The only thing worse than Taylor's acting was Stanwyck's singing. She got better later in Ball of Fire-thank ciel.",0
"Divorced single mom in quaint seaside town finds an anonymous love letter and allows it to spur into action her dormant love life. Pet project for actress/co-producer Kate Capshaw, who gives a caliente, nicely-modulated lead performance, nevertheless this story is so slim and the orientation and edited so irregular that a faint dissatisfaction creeps in. Initially, Capshaw's Helene envisions several of her friends reading the love letter to her (an interesting visual joke) but the first person they do this ploy with is Helene DeGeneres, who doesn't play a lesbian but who comes off as one because of this ploy. Different ideas are flayed about in the hopes that one would stick, and the continuance is uncommonly troubled. Supporting cast (including Tom Selleck and Tom Everett Scott, who mostly acts with his shirt off) is very good, but they can't economize the final legislation, which is disappointing. Low-keyed, in a quirky, delightful way, but it is blandly good-natured, nada more. **1/2 from ****",0
"I must be honest, I like romantic comedies, but this was not what I had hoped for. I thought Helene Degeneres was having the biggest part, which should have been, because I didn't like the two struggling bed partners. It was heinous. Poor Tom Selleck!! He had to act with someone who was that much in the picture while it should have been him and Ellen to be in most of the film. They were the only believable ones. And the only really hilarious parts starred them, not Kate Capshaw and that Everett guy.. Cool that mommy is coming out of the closet, I brainchild that was a lovely surprise. <br /><br />I'm just glad I saw it on the cords and I didn't pay any money renting it..",0
"First of all, Blythe Danner doesn't look anywhere NEAR old enough to play Capshaw's daughter (and in fact she isn't -- only ten years apart).<br /><br />I understand this is supposed to be one of those magical, Moonstruck type uncanny romances but this is beyond the pale. Supremely, very vulnerable in terms of acting, script and direction. <br /><br />The only one who genuinely shines here is Ellen DeGeneres, who makes this film watchable -- if not really dependable herself as she's cast as a bit of a heterosexual sex hound. But endearing nonetheless. Actually, DeGeneres and the skin shots of the young guy Capshaw dallies with together make this watchable. But no one can really tell if Capshaw is really in love with the young guy or not; neither the script nor her acting pull it together for us and we're left to wonder how she really feels.",0
"This is a movie about people receiving a love letter. Nobody knows who sent in and nobody knows who it is for. A alright cast, headed up by Kate Capshaw, Tom Selleck and Ellen DeGeneres. This, conversely, is a totally dopey intrigue. As an example, the Capshaw character, one of the leading citizens of a small town in New England, takes up with an immature college student who works in her bookstore during the summer. She chooses him instead of Tom Selleck, the town firefighter who is crazy about her. If that isn't the epitome of craziness, I don't know what is. Just an instances of how dopey this movie is. Watching Kate Capshaw jog is a joy, but you immediately realize that she has never jogged a day in her life. Another definitely dopey part of a dopey movie.",0
"A movie about a mysterious love letter that puts a small town on its ear should be fun, romantic and easy-going entertainment. Instead this movie is more about things not said and not expressed, so it gets to the point where you are grateful anything is said at all, even if the dialogue is not exactly quotable. <br /><br />SPOILER --<br /><br />When the relationship that says the most is the one least seen on the screen (Danner and McEwan), you know you're in trouble. But those two actors are a very welcomed vision in a movie screaming for some authentic people.<br /><br />END OF SPOILER<br /><br />Capshaw is given the task of creating a character from not much and she is not altogether successful. Like I said above, the theme seems to be oppression and I understand that is an element of life and love but I don't want to see a movie about it either, at least not this one. <br /><br />I can't recommending this at all, although the very gifted casting who are left to fend for themselves.",0
"**Possible Spoilers**	From Dreamworks and director Peter Chan, `The Love Letter' is a romantic comedy that takes place in a picturesque, New England coastal village where single mom Helen (Kate Capshaw) owns a quaint, little bookstore. One day at work, Helen happens across an anonymous letter (the `love letter' of the title) that has somehow become lodged beneath the cushions of a reading couch. Upon reading the amorous prose therein, she believes it has been written to her, purposely placed in the couch for her to find, and, for reasons of her own, thinks she knows the identity of her secret admirer. Inadvertently, however, Helen leaves the letter out where her employee, Janet (Ellen DeGeneres) finds it, believes it to be for her, and, of course, thinks she knows who wrote it. Circumstances then bring it into the possession of a young man named Johnny (Tom Everett Scott), who thinks Helen has written the letter to him. And before it all gets sorted out, you can only imagine the hilarious situations into which all of those involved have been cast; and I do mean imagine, because the way this movie plays out, the viewers gets little more from it than what it brings along itself. There are two specific area in which this sentimental humour fails spectacularly: It simply isn't very sentimental, and it's not funny; and that is a potent combo that causes this film to misfire hardly from the opening credits. Once the setting and main character (Helen) have been established, it primarily goes somewhere for the next ninety minutes or so. By the time you finally find out who actually wrote the letter, and to whom, you could care less. Rounding out the cast is Tom Selleck, Blythe Danner, Julianne Nicholson, Gloria Stuart and Geraldine McEwan. It's a shame to see such talent wasted on such claptrap as this, and looking bad in the balance. Kate Capshaw, who usually brightens up the screen just by showing up, looks tired here, while Selleck appears to have just come in off a three day bender that's lasted a week. Ellen DeGeneres actually comes away looking the best of the bunch. It is said that the journey is often a more heady experience than the destination. In the case of `The Love Letter,' however, it would have been best for all concerned if everybody had just stayed home in the first place. I rate this one 1/10.",0
"A really hilarious story brainchild with good actors but it misses somehow. The actors are older but none of them looked particularly good. They needed better make up,photography or something.It is supposed to be a love story and yet the film had more of the rough look of a street film. I liked the cast but I think the performances were rather bland. This is where the weakness of the director shows. Perhaps if Mrs. Spielberg had Mr. Spielberg directing it would have been a much better film.",0
"I loved the first 15 minutes, and I loved some of the discussions in the tribunal--which proved to be the best showcase for the director's ahead-of-its-time method acting technique--but this kino ultimately disappoints. Even when regarded mere as a metaphor of the oppressor/oppressed vibrant that were and are prevailing in the ties between the US government and its more ""disobedient"" citizens, it nevertheless absence punch and believability, and lastly left me looking at my watch expecting the apparent ending would happen already.<br /><br />And for the record: despite rampant rumors to the contrary, this movie has never been forbid in the US (I can't comment on the rumors of UK censorship, but I'm suspicious). Hollywood refused to distribute it after its initial film festival showing, and I am more than willing to believe the Nix government had some influence on this decision; however, the fact that it never appeared on American television is merely a reflection of this medium's rather careful and advertising-driven fashion of doing business. As for the present, you can have your very own copy of the DVD handed to your door via Amazon in a few days.",0
"Committed doom and gloomer Peter Watkins goes slummin' across the pond to take on the American justice system circa 1971 with this precious slice of zeitgeist paranoia that leans so far left it falls over perpetually. Watkins is sheer tourist as he assembles this our gang tragedy with clich√© freaks, hippies and black revolutionaries pitted against trigger happy cops and military and a kangaroo court tribunal made up of disapproving calcified adults making poor fashion statements. Talk about a revolution.<br /><br />In Punishment Park we have radical youth versus corrupt system as dissenters convicted of crimes are given the choice of imprisonment or a three day trek across Punishment Park (Death Valley) and freedom. Of course the law enforcement officials monitoring their journey aren't about to play fair and combined with the stifling heat the fate of our protagonists looks sealed.<br /><br />Punishment Park has elements of Kafka in setting as well as topics. Trials are held under a large canvas tent where shackled prisoners shout defiance at a hardcore love it or leave it group of inquisitors (such as members of Silent Majority for a Peaceful America) who snarl back. Neither group spends much time listening to the other and the proceedings sometime takes on a teen parent battle over the keys to the car look. Mostly its just one side saying what's wrong with America the other saying what's right with no one offering solutions for change. Meanwhile the Punishment Park martyrs stumble endlessly about the dessert while cops with guns act like twelve year olds. It kind of has the look and feel of some of my 70's college film making class when we were younger and knew more then than we do now.<br /><br />Peter Watkins has always been on the side of the underdog and the common man against what he perceives as a corrupt powerful few. Culledon was a strong indictment of military atrocity in 18th century Scotland that still resonates. War Game is a raw sobering look at nuclear aftermath that should be required viewing for all. Punishment Park has its value as well but for other than intended reason. Watkins vision today is a textbook example of the left in full inclination counter culture 70s paranoia and given the times ( Vietnam, Kent State, The Chicago 7) such strident hysteria seemed not that great a distance from the truth. But 35 years later the fever has subsided and Punishment Park with it's unrestrained narrow viewpoint is a quite moronic ride.",0

In the 100 degree heat, the prisoners are to trek fifty some odd miles to an American flag for their freedom. US and state law enforcers will follow two hours latter. If the dissidents are captures it means imprisonment.<br /><br />Appears in this pseudo-documentary: Carmen Argenziano, Catherine Quittner, Mary Ellen Kleinhall, Stan Armsted, Scott Turner, Patrick Boland and Kent Forman.",0
"This movie should have been called ""The Eyes of Alexander"", and they should have done away with the Bogart notions altogether. The film started out with a lighthearted approach to Bogart's legacy and some comical moments with his surgery oriented face, but after the first 15-30 mins it morphs into a more weighty thriller, where two palm size sapphires, purportedly laid as eyes into a marble headpiece of Alexander the Great, for him, and seen by him, right before his death. So the gems are of great value not only because of their quality and size, but also because of the tie to the Greatest conquerer the world has ever known. Being an expert on Alexander qualifies me to say that this is wholly and completely a fiction, but it makes for a good movie anyway. Therefore the cinematography headwinds throughout some early silliness and stumbles along with all sorts of Aleksander overtones in both the foreground and background (which I really loved), ending with a dated sharks attack (you couldn't go to a movie in '79-'80 without some shark showing up to menace the audience). There is a yacht named Euridice (Alexander's father's young wife), a man named Alexander, Philip, Cleitus?, (it's been about 5 years since I've seen the film, so can't remember all the details), Olympias, some street names, and many others. It was fun to watch the film just to try to catch all the background details that the director (obviously an Alexanderphile himself) put in. When all is said and done, the eyes are retrieved and the camera pans in on them on a bed as the credits roll by. Kinds of a neat terminated. What would have been more fun would be if they went the Indiana Jones way and had an action adventure. There were many, many real artefacts that could have been used to make this more interesting, or instance, the hand-annotated (by Aristotle) version of the Iliad that Aleksandr kept with him all his life, even on his many distances across Asian (would be of incalculable value if found today). Olivia Hussey (my all time favorite b-movie actor)is assassinated off way too early, and should have been the main actress throughout, not the girl from the Momma's and the Poppa's...though she was herself easy on the eyes. If you can find this flick, it might be worth checking out for the historical stuff and to see Olivia Hussey in an extremely funny deadpan humor bit early on, but beyond that, I'd pass on it for something more entertaining.<br /><br />Yours, Nick",0
"The Man with Bogart's Confronting sets it self up to mine the viewers nostalgia for the late 30's-late 40's film era. It fails woefully for dissimilar motif. First, Sacchi, while looking reasonably like Bogart and even speaking like him on occassion and using his mannerisms, completely shortage any of Bogart's charisma or acting ability. This is really apparent whenever Sacchi is not clearly imitating a scene from one of Bogart's films. Second, the film does not have the first rates character actors Bogart was able to work with. There are no Pedro Lorre's or Sydney Greenstreet's in this one, folks. Sure we are handled to performances by Victor Buaeno, Olivier Hussey and George Raft amongst others, but they just aren't of the same caliber (or aren't given enough screen time or are miscast). Third, the attempts at ""modern"" humor all fall through. All of the underwear jokes, having Marlowe almost *never* remove that damn hat and trench coat (even though Bogart would have), etc. just aren't funny and genuinely pulls down this film. Fourth, I've never heard a goofier theme song this side of Michel. Eventually, the film's specious reverence for Bogart (and other classic actors work) is honestly irksome. Bogart almost *never* played a straight hero, on those occasions he was a hero. He played complicated characters. This movie makes Bogart out to be a trigger-happy, moralistic do-gooder. While this may have been true about some film characters, Bogart's characters rarely fit that bill. It's cinema like this that make people unexposed to the cinema of the past think that all of it is hokey, ""good guy beats the bad guys and gets the girl"" crap with low productivity values.",0
"Young spinster, who doesn't associate with women her own age and is eyed by gentleman from the retirement set, urged an apparently mute young man into her apartment on a rainy day. Nervous and overly-polite to hide her own sexual insecurities, she is most pleased when the boy makes himself to home in her guest bedroom...but not so happy when he begins sneaking out the window at night. Sandy Denys is not a hapless actress, but why she was lured to these sad-sack duties I guess we'll never know. Founded on a ledger by Richard Miles, and about as far removed from a commercial drama as one could got, this lurid material not only attracted Dennis but also headmaster Robert Altman (whose work is static, at best). The narrative appears almost a sex-reversal of ""The Collector"", a tag which may have sold the film-rights but which doesn't turn out to be a good idea cinematically. Even the film's best sequence (Dennis shopping for a prostitute to satisfy her prisoner) doesn't quite come off, with Sandy acting both patient and indignant (whose idea was this plan?). Michael Burns is utterly good as the kid who uses this frumpy, pasty-sick woman just for her comfy digs, but he's handled too bashfully by Altman, with lots of strategically-placed towels and flesh-colored undies (Altman clearly wasn't ready for a mature picture with adult themes at this point). Sandy Denis has a fistful of very alright scenes; she doesn't gossip away mindlessly here, she feels before she speaks and she's alarmingly careful in her actions. Regretfully, the role itself is a bummer, with an blatant slipping into mental deteriorating which seems to happen off-screen. As such, the sharp finale is maddening, and the holistic conclusions tibia. *1/2 from ****",0
"""The Next Karate Kid"" is a thoroughly foreseeable movie, just like its predecessors. Its predictability often results in a feeling of impatience on the viewer's part, who often wishes the story could move a little faster. Despite its lulls and its extreme familiarity, however, this fourth entry in the series is painless, almost exclusively because of the presence of Morita. He doesn't seem tired of his role, and he does inject some life and humor into the film, becoming the best reason for you to see it. Not awful, but nothing much, either.",0
"I can accept the fact this was the NEXT kicks petit so Ralph Macchio can be happily retired from the series, and while Hillary Swank is fabulous for the role....the intrigue to the movie is just frightful.<br /><br />Mr. Miyagi's old buddy from World War 2 dies, leaving his widow to take care of her rebellious grand-daughter when her parents die in an accident. The girl has no discipline yet is the hero because the local ROTC...which I'll explain in a minute, has it out to get her. You know the drill...Miyagi takes her under his wing and in the end they beat the bad guys and everyone lives happily ever after.<br /><br />Its hokey, its cheesy, its the 90's....but that's not even the long and the short of it. My first instances of ""eh?"" is why is there a ""military division"" in high school? I thought that stuff went out in the 1960's, especially in a public school. As much as Michael Ironside kicks booty in his role as the main heel, since when is military involved in a high school? My next gripe is that during the prom scene, the militants bungee jump to scare the crap out of people....why? The thing I noticed throughout all 4 movies was at the very end the heels suddenly turn face after all the nonsense they put the main character through (Billy in part 1, Sato in part 2, Kreese in part 3). This cinema is no several. After Ned and cronies basically sabotage the senior prom, blow up Eric's car and threaten Hillary Swank the whole movie.....Ironside tells them to beat her up and they're like ""um...no"" If you're gonna do unhappy face turns, at least make sure the characters haven't done anything too over the top such as blowing up a hot rod.<br /><br />As for the rest of the amore plot between Eric and Hillary Swank....corny but none to melodramatic, which is a breath of fresh aviation from the wastes Ralph Macchio pulling in the first 3 movies.<br /><br />I will say for its own movie, after watching the first 3 films, I can admit it being more or less a spin off...but I can't accept the whole military thing, way too uncommon for it to be taken seriously. Now if Ironside and crew was a wrestling/football team and he was the coach, THAT would have been more believable.<br /><br />Ironside and Morita deliver the goods, Swank is OK...the rest are the same as anything, the one highlight is when they blow up the hot rod, THAT was cool 4 out of 10",0
"I am truly regretful that this is the first unfavourable exams I've ever made for a movie...EVER.I could stand to watch this movie, and it is the second movie in all the movies I've seen that is just...a downgrade. The first is Open Water, that just had NO point whatsoever. The Next Kicks Kid didn't have any mention of Daniel(correct me if I'm wrong, please.),and that ending line came as a shock. It was like, ""If must fight...win."" then it showed the bird flying around and the pan flute was playing, and I was like, oh. Okay, so it'll take a while for this next part. AND THEN THE CREDENCE HIT THE SCREEN.<br /><br />GEEZ MAN!! Fortunately, I will never have to reviews a movie in a bad manner again, I apologize for those of you who like The Next Karate Petit, I really, really do...",0
They missed up the movie when the tried to use some one diffrent. They should of keeped Ralph Macchio as Danny instead of changing it. And accomplished more Kicks Child with him in it.And also many people were woundering what happen to Danny when they jumped from 3 to 5 and no four.,0
"The latter installment in the Kicks Kid series is predictable, poorly acted, and so bad it boundaries on the pleasurable. But not quite, it's just negative. In this installment Ralph Macchio's Karate Kid is absent, already having been in one too many of the episodes. The new Kid, played by Hillary Swank, is the teenage granddaughter of one of Mr. Miyogi's WWII buddies. Her parents are recently deceased and her grandmother is unsuccessfully trying to raise this young hellion. In strides Mr. Miyogi to set things right. Real to formulas, there is a group of neo-Fascist bullies, called the Alpha Troopers that must be put in their place and a new karate move, called the Praying Mantis. As I said before this movie is a chaos, and should be averted.",0
"Enchanted April was one of Harry Beaumont's last movies- he only directed a few more after this one. He had made the ""Maisie"" movies in the 1930s and 1940s. In the opening credits, it says ""From the novel by Elizabeth"", and completely leaves off the author's last name... rather odd, but since it was von Armin, they may not have wanted the German association at the time... Sad to hear it was a flop when it was released, with those fun names like Frank Morgan (the Wizard) and Jessie Ralph, who played W.C. Fields' disapproving mother- in- law in ""Bank Dick"". Two gals in London (Ann Harding & Katharine Alexander) decide to rent a castle to host two of their friends, but things don't go the way they planned. Reginald Owen plays the husband with multiple personalities. Aside from a few funny moments, it DOES move pretty lento. Ralph is the only brightest spot here, as the overbearing take-charge type, and the picture is quite obscure and out of focus for much of the film. The views of Italy are all obvious backdrops. The only saving grace here is that the Turner Classic version is only 66 minutes long. Too bad they didn't give Frank Morgan a larger role. This was remade in 1992 by the BBC as a British Film.",0
"I found this to be a tremendously depressing version of a charming story. I thought the acting was on the whole quite good. Reginald Owen did chew the scenery, as mentioned by others, but I found him moderately amusing in his brief scenes. TCM has made an Ann Harding fan of me, and I thought she was fine as usual here. Jessie Ralph had a field day as the old battleaxe, ordering everybody around, and Frank Morgan, as always, played Frank Morgan with a twinkle.<br /><br />For me, the problem was the script and/or the editing--transitions were awkward, motivations were murky. The movie was just too darned short to convey the story properly! I felt completely let down, particularly since I had such fond memories of the later version.",0
"The 1935 version of ""Enchanted April"" administered to be meanwhile monotonous<br /><br />and perfunctory. It is arduous to show the transformative magical of Italia shooting in a studio with only stereotypical Italian behavior to belabor. The transformation of the four strangers fleeing London is instantaneous in the cut from the first day to a week later. Rather than develop, the screenplays flips a switch and the<br /><br />characters are different.<br /><br />The husbands are boring enough in flashbacks without turning up, even if their presence does not drive the four women back into their shells and/or hostilities.<br /><br />Jessie Ralph has the most hilarious (moving instead of entirely chewing up the<br /><br />scenery) and Katharine Alexander has some poignant charm out of her<br /><br />husband's shadow (and away from his hideous droning). Ann Harding is<br /><br />unremarkable here (with the Production Code being enforced). She had an<br /><br />appropriate line in an earlier (pre-Code) movie, ""When Ladies Meet"": ""You're<br /><br />not worth a minute of one anxious hour that either one of us has given you,"" but in ""Enchanted April"" can only look hurt, rush out, and proclaim fealty to her errant husband.",0
"The fundamental narratives thinking of ENCHANTED APRIL is excellent--two very unhappy wives meet and decide to pool their funds to rent an Italian villa for a month. To further defray costs, they get two other strangers to come along. What makes it interesting are the relationships both before and during this vacation--in particular, showing how this beautiful setting actually changes their outlooks on life. Unluckily, this good thinks is abundantly spoiled by two essential performances in the whole cast that are so negative that they ruination the film. Ann Harding plays the most important role in the film in a manner that makes her seem ridiculous. Her ""doe-eyed"" expression and vacant stares really make you wonder if this isn't a zombie movie or she's just meant to be an idiot! And to deliver it lousiest, Jerome Irving plays a character so obnoxious and bombastic that I was very close to turning off the film--he was that frightful and phenomenal. I noticed that at least one reviewer gave this movie a 10--which is very, very difficult to understand. Sure, the film has great ambiance and a good plot, but these two glaringly silly performances cannot be overlooked as they detract the rest of the picture. Sorry, but this film was aching for a re-make!",0
"I struggle to see the point of this movie. It is supposed to be a comedy but I didn't laugh once. The storyline is one that could have been interesting in a well made movie, but since this is acted by comics, the result is totally astonishing (as comedies should be). The Comic strip series was very hit and miss, even withing the episodes, and it is fair to say all of the people involved have gone on to do greater things. One to avoid. I have also just found out that comments have to be 10 lines long. The whole point of these comments is to give an indication of whether the movie is worth watching: not write an essay gushing about it or taking it apart. If you like: Seinfeld, Larry Sanders, the Young Ones, Alan Partridge, Arrested Development, Curb, Red Dwarf, then you might like to pass on this. On the other hand, if you like lame jokes such as can be found in Friends and Dodgeball, enjoy watching this!",0
"Hard up, No proper jobs going down at the pit, why not rent your kids! DIY pimp story without the gratuitous sex scenes, either hard core or soft core, accordingly reads like a public information film from the forties, give this a extensive mademoiselle, use a barge pole if you can.",0
"Well OK, I've seen Wrath of the Ninja.<br /><br />It isn't something that I would recommend to people who aren't seriously into japanese fighting movies. This is a sorting of japanese fighting ninja movie, with a sophisticated plot. It's about these 3 old ninja schools that had these 3 ""Swords of Sorcery"". I saw the subtitled version (NOT recommended by the way, it's easy to miss something) and I didn't really conserving up with it all. It had some good scenes tough, but in general, it wasn't much to my taste.",0
"It's perfectly okay that people dies in an animation, but there are just way too several dies in this one. Commenced from the very beginning, the story is all around battles, fights, death, and revenge. It goes on and on for entire one and a half hour. It was interesting at the beginning, but I augment very tyre after before the exhibition was half way through. Unlike other animations, this one is shortages of comedy. There are not many interactions between the characters either. The good thing about it is the swords fight scene looks pretty good and the characters look nice.",0
"I kind of had somewhat high expectations for this cinematography. I've always thought that Thom Selleck's lesser known theater (ci Rampant and Coma), where well above the ones he had more press for. Maybe the producers should have had a little more acquaintances about former major league baseball players who became stars overseas. The majority were players too good for triple a baseball, but not exactly major league mat√©riel. I admire the brainchild of putting Selle's's characters in Japn, versus the clich√© of having play in the minors. Sad to say, this movie, much like the title of the post, is stranded at third by a movie that seems to be running on autopilot. I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel, and hopefully, the producers would learn from the mistakes. The premise is just way too unique to be left lonely with this unequal movie",0
"It's a kinder, gentler Cyborg movie with a love story. Awww. It's not as bad as it sounds. The action, when it is there, is decent and Jack Palance, Elias Koteas, and Angelina Jolie are always dependable. It's the fact that this is a sequel to the terrible Jean Claude Van Damme film, or is that the capper to the Masters of the Universe trilogy? I'm still confused about that. Either way, there was really no require for this movie. What was there a need for? Angelina Jolie. She may play an assassin robot that can explodes mid-coitus, but, what a way to go and even though this is her first movie, she still has the presence that made her an award winner.",0
"This cinema is a cyborg in and of itself: half nonsensical/half Lifetime Originals Cinematography.<br /><br />As a cyborg, this movie has but one intention: to make you wish that you had spent the duration of the film in a dark room punching yourself in the testicles.<br /><br />Unlike many people, I did not tenancy this movie because of Angelina Jolie(I'll explain why I rented it shortly). I am not a big fan of Ms. Jolie's, though I will say that her performance was stellar! Her blanc stare and robotic acting really did have me think that she was an android prostitute. If anyone has a clip of her on 'Inside the Actor's Studio' explaining how she prepared for this role, please send it my way. I'll make sure to use it when I try James Lipton for Crimes against Integrity.<br /><br />So what drove me to rents this movie? One would think that it was the hope of seeing Angelina Jolie's nipples, but it wasn't. No, the grounds backside this rental rested only on one of the pictures on the covered of the DVD; that of Jack Palance's face! HALF OF HIS FACE WAS ROBOTIC! When I saw that, I figured legions of ""Palances"" slowly marching through a fiery wasteland, laying waste to any humans that were foolish enough to resist. In my mind's eye, every member of this Unholy Army of Palances had a red, glowing eye; a red, glowing eye that looked at humans and saw only ""meat"". They were to be the Architects of Oblivion...a cold, steely Apocalypse...a Nightmare from which Humanity would never awaken. It's a wondrous photography that I will cherished till the end of my years.<br /><br />Like most things in my life, the real movie did not inhabit up to my outlook. No, there was only 'one' Jack Palance, and the only visible cybernetic enhancements that he had were located on his legs. Sadly, those enhancements didn't really ""enhance"" anything. That is unless, you count WALKING LIKE A POLIO VICTIM as a super power. At least their was a scene where Jack--grinning like a trigger-happy Alzheimer's patient--got to shoot the hell out of some people. I was waiting for him to yell, ""I'm damn tired of paying too much for prescription medication!"" Unfortunately, any outbursts of geriatric rage were few and far between.<br /><br />What the movie did have an abundance of was a poorly developed love story about a man(Elias Koteas, a.k.a. poor man's De Niro) and a cyborg(Angelina Jolie, a.k.a. Demon Spawn of John Voigt). Oh man, can the love between a Romeo of Flesh and a Juliet of Silicon ever be able to last?!?!?! It can if you follow Jack Palance's simple advice: ""You have to TASTE each other's TIME"".<br /><br />Yeah, I'm not sure what that means. However, I am sure that I do not want Jack Palance to be the one to explain it to me. I sure as heck don't want him to show me! As an experiment, I suggest that you ask your significant other if he/she ""thinks that we have reached a level in our relationship where we can begin to TASTE each other's TIME?""",0
"Cybrog 2:Glass Shadow stars Elias Koteas as Colton Hicks (Rhymes with kicks!) a karate instructor who helps a Cash (Jolie) escape from Pinwheel, her creators who look to detonate her and destroy a rival company. Along the way Billy Drago and Karen Shepherd show up to displace the duo, while Jack Palance is there to deliver guidance to the duo on the run. One of the things that is quite shocking about the Cyborg franchise, is how the series has managed to have quite prolific and off beat actors in the cast. The original had Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dayle Haddon (Don't know her? Well she was in a bunch of 70's pornos) this one has Jack Palance, Elias Koteas,Billy Drago and Angelina Jolie. The third one has William Katt, Zach Galligan and Malcom McDowell. (Okay so, Cyborg 3's cast isn't that impressive.) I've never seen Cyborg 3, but I did see this on Sci-Fi channel and must admit I wasn't impressed. Actually hitting that, Cyborg 2 is an generally wondrous looking movie, it's shot with excellent style and the visual detail make this easy on the eye. Still Cyborg 1 was the same way, indeed the movie was directed with a certain amount of style, slow motion and music that made it all easy on the eye. Sadly like the first, this one doesn't have any new ideas or anything resembling a plot or texture. Most of the ideas are taken from Blade Runner and Max Headroom, so for various reasons the movie doesn't have much to offer beyond it's look. Another aspect is the fearsome acting. Karen Shepherd and Billy Drago are absolutely fearsome and Angelina Jolie isn't much better. Elias Koteas and Jack Palance come off fine but seriously Palance is playing a cyborg warrior and Koteas is a karate instructor. I guess on the positive side you can't accuse Michael Schroeder of not being ambitious with casting. However the kino is uninspiring and I for one lost interest in the story fifteen minutes in. Also why did they tie it in with Cyborg anyway? It has nothing to do with it's predecessor, which this manages to be worse than.<br /><br />* out of 4-(Bad)",0
"This movie moved much too slowly for my taste.The conceptions of the story is delightfully different in that it explores the family dynamics of living with a mentally-retarded family member in a way that I have not previously seen on-screen.Instead,the execution of the concept was flawed.Each character was developed fully within the scene of her first appearance,then one had to endure the feeling that each character was treading water the rest of the way.That is,each character flailed about awkwardly in her interpersonal relationships with others in the movie,which I found to be a form of emotional and social retardation.I suppose this has artistic merit,given the irony that the story centers around an intellectually retarded individual surrounded by way above-average intelligence friends and family.The acting,however,was well-done without exception.I agree with other reviewers that the filmmaking was beautiful.In summary,I think the film has strong artistic merit because of the fine acting and cinematography,but fails on an emotional level due to the shortcomings described.",0
"I finally got hold of a DVDS photocopied of this production and was agog with curiosity, since I had read so many people praise it to the skies, particularly Angela Lansbury's portrayal of Mrs. Lovett. I saw the Tim Burton movie a few months ago and thought it over the top and unreasonably bloody; joyfully this stepping is not so spooky gory but it undergo tremendously in too many other ways for it to be in the fewer gratifying to me.<br /><br />To begin with, the moulding. George Hearn is proper and at less shows some words (as opposing to Johnny Depp's unending timber encounter in the kino). Angela Lansbury is, rather exclusively, annoying. At least she has enough power in her voice to get the point across as opposed to Helena Bonham Carter's piping and expressionless little girl's voice, but subtlety seems to be only a word in the vocabulary to Ms. Lansbury. One cannot be drawn into the story when one of the main characters spends her entire time mugging and winking in a ""look, Ma, I'm acting!"" fashion and being far too aware of the audience. This is not something that is typical of phase productions, heaven knows--I have been a regular attendee of many productions at the Stratford Festial for many years and stage protagonists do NOT behave in that fashion as a rule (at least those who want to continue to find regular employment do not!)...<br /><br />Betsy Joslyn. Oh dear, oh darling, oh dear. Did anybody besides me advices that she can't sing this role even vaguely appropriately? And her playing George Hearn's daughter is just scary, considering that she was married to him at the time. Isn't she supposed to be a sweet little sixteen-year-old? Yes, I achieve that this is what acting is all about, but not once did she persuading me that she was any younger than about thirty-five, and the phrase ""mutton clothed as mouton"" seem to have been invented just for her. Her butchering of ""Green Finch And Linnet Bird"" had me gnashing my teeth and ready to turn off the DVDS player at once. That song was done so well in Tim Burton's movie, and this was a sorrowful shock. The song requires the vocal range of Julie Andrews in the 1960's and a purity of voice that is only comparable to that of a boy soprano. Any vibrato at all kills it dead, and Ms. Joslyn spent the entire time warbling so hard that I thought she was about to fall off of her ladder because she was trembling so much from the effort at sustaining coloratura notes with a voice that is a mezzo at best. Let us pass over the spectacle of her vibrating at least a quarter tone flat on at least three of the higher notes... This is quite simply not a coloratura role and perhaps a discerning director should have told her that--but the fact that she was married to the star might possibly have tied the director's hands.<br /><br />Cris Groenendaal was adequate, but again obviously far too old for the role and there is zero chemistry between him and Ms. Joslyn, which makes the whole subplot fall completely flat. I am reminded a little of past stage productions of Wagner's Ring cycle where, due to the vocal power required for the singers to bellow over the sound of a full Wagnerian orchestra they would have to cast based upon ability to penetrate vocally as opposed to any appearance or acting ability or even a good voice, which is why you have the caricature of the massive mountainous Viking-horned Brunehilde with a triple chin and a beard, when the libretto calls for an ethereal beauty who is eternally young and bewitching. The casting of the ""juvenile"" leads is exactly like that--if you close your eyes you can almost believe in Mr. Groenendaal's Anthony, but as soon as you look at the screen the illusion is shattered. (And at NO time can you ever believe in Ms. Joslyn's Johanna...) For me, the rest of the production was completely lost because of three out of the four major characters were so obviously miscast. I cannot give a proper review of anything else because they were so distracting that they spoiled the rest of the production. I really can't understand why people rave about this badly-shot and self-conscious filming of a stage play. Surely there's more to camera work in the theatre than just plunking a camera down in the front row? If I want that, I'll go to a decent play, preferably at the Stratford Festival, where at least they work together for the production and aren't constantly mugging for the camera. I give it three stars only because the quality of the production apart from the antics of Lansbury and Joslyn seems adequate if not spectacular.<br /><br />Probably the best thing one can do is buy the soundtrack of the film and a cast recording of this play, and then combine the two to make a bearable whole. That's what I'm going to do, and try to forget that I ever bothered to rent this wholly unremarkable production.",0
"Among the many distinctions here for this production, there was one individual whose comments asked if he/she were the only one (who wasn't that enthralled by it) - i.e. giving this film 3 stars. However, the comment went on to indicate an overall liking of the story, and other production of same. Well, this person isn't the ""only one,"" who didn't like this production (include me!) but there I part company even with him/her. If you put a pistol to my head and asked me to make a choice between your shooting me or watching this gesture again, I'd watch it, certainly - but I'd probably spend 10 seconds thinking about it. I'd much prefer being locked into solitary confinement, or having to watch paint dry on a wall, though. Further, I wouldn't want to see this story again, anytime, anywhere, or in any alternative presentations. Sometimes you feel like comedian George Gobel's ""pair of brown shoes when the rest of the world is a tuxedo,"" and this is one of those for me. I wished Angela Lansbury in a favorite movie of mine, ""Long Hot Summer,"" and while not a huge fan of the show, appreciated ""Killed, She Wrote."" But HERE -- I not only didn't healthcare for the story or other aspects, but I unearthed Angela's squealing, squawking, singing, and everything else about her over-the-top performance, perhaps the GREATEST GALLING presence in any cinema (or presentation in any other media) I've ever seasoned. It was like an eternal continuation of Audrey Hepburn's equally ""over-the top"" Cockney chortling at Rex Harrison - in the earlier portion of ""My Fair Lady."" But that was incidents to the plot, presented for light, comedic effect, and (mercifully) brief. Unmercifully, this was something but brief, and to me seemed as if it had gone-on for about 10 hours (Einstein's layman's explanation of ""relativity"" at work.) Though I hadn't been with friends, with the necessity to remain, MY viewing would have been brief. I smiled, though, at the ""Seinfeld"" episode where Lise pisses everyone off because she tells them how much she disliked ""The English Patient."" My friends slightly regarded me the same way when I discontinued their waxing ecstatically over this movie. Give me some dragging fingernails loudly over a chalk board anytime instead.",0
"Okay, I just had to sound off on this one... Like a phenomenal mental-gimp, I've just sat through this film in its entirety.<br /><br />You'll note that the trivia section of IMDB points out that portions of the raising of the 747 were ""loaned"" from Airport 1977. This really doesn't graze the surfaces... Virtually all exterior shots of the plane skimming the ocean, landing in, sinking, and even the at-rest shots are borrowed from Airport '77. All of the ""raising"" shots are pulled from '77, including most of the interior flooding clips, with the exception of Dennis Weaver's drowning. I couldn't help but wonder if Olivia Dehavilland might come floating by at any moment, or maybe a ""dead"" Tom Sullivan. Another eye-roller: Dennis Weaver's name in this film is Stevens, which is to compensate for the fact that Airport '77's plane is owned by the Stevens Corporation (headed by Jimmie Sylvain of course).<br /><br />This is a truthful calvalcade of protagonists who don't work much, or at least haven't worked in a while, which might have been the first clue that it was going to be a authentic tosser.<br /><br />I've rated this film a 2 - It's quite worthy of a ""1"", but if this film can't offer any other redeeming quality, at least somebody helped Coolio, Max Caulfield, Nicolle Eggert, and Dennis Weaver make their car payment that month!",0
"""Immersed"" is decidedly NOT ""the meanest movie ever"". It does have its weaknesses, such as borrowed footage, crazy script and non-existent special effects (these are the worst), but it also has some good dot too. The acting is stunningly good, there are LOTS of accustomed faces whom you probably know if u're a b-movie fan like me.<br /><br />I was very glad to see Brent Huff playing one of the heroes, knowing him mostly for his 80's action films, and i must admit, he is not a inclement actor at all. Fred Williamson, Maxwell Caulfield & Tim Thomerson get some limited screen time, but are believable in their parts. The ""eye-candies"" in this Fred Olen Ray movie are Yvette Nipar and Nicole Eggert, both looking very sexy and very mean. Michael Bailey Smith adds some muscle to the background as a Navy SEALED. Sadly the only cast member who (in my opinion) is completely out of place is Coolio. He doesn't act at all, talks like he didn't even read the script, and being a badass in the beginning of the movie, gets shot like a wimp a hour later. Not a good choice.<br /><br />To sum this movie up - this is not such a negative choice for late night recreational. If you can get over the special effects thing (so many guns, so much fire, and not a single wound on anyone), Coolio's vexing performance, and the recycled footage from Airport 77, you might fond this no-brainer after all.",0
"While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoons, this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going to Africa and disguising themselves in the stereotypical burnt cork makeup to try to blend in. While the dialect humor is predominantly lame, there is a concise musical sequence involving ""black skeletons"" that was amusing. I have to asks still, how could Tom and Jerry still have their makeup stay on even after being dumped in the water a couple of times?

Once they're wearing it, they adopt black dialect and totally live their new characters. They crash into the ocean and use the wing of the plane as a raft. Before reaching land, they suffer the advances of an over-affectionate octopus and more serious danger from sharks, a swordfish and a whale. Once on land, they're frightened by fantastic creatures, and duck into a cave. Inside it's even worse when they encounter living skeletons in blackface. And upon exiting the cave, things are even worst than that when they are detected by cannibals.<br /><br />""Planes Silly"" is an especially remiss endeavor from Van Beuren Studios. One example: a lion, unknown to Tom and Gerry, enters the cave before they do. But the animators owe have omitted about it, because the lion never appears again. Another example is the ending that's not an ending: it's just an arbitrary stop.<br /><br />According to a YouTube poster, the cartoon ""was originally intended to feature the voices AND caricatures of a popular 'Negro' parody team known as Miller & Lyles. But Aubrey Lyles died of tuberculosis before the inscription session was completed, and co-directors John Foster & George Rufle were forced to rework the animation into a 'Tom & Jerry' story.""<br /><br />They shouldn't have bothered.

There are some cartoons that are racist but they are classics, being a mixed woman I have the right to say this, but if you are into the historical aspect of these funnies try Merrie Melodic ""Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs"" or ""Angel Puss"" you won't find them on DVD because the distributors promised not to put them in the mainstream, but you can find them on a site as YouTube.

Acutely devoid of anything inventive, beating the same cliches to death, yet loosely entertain in a mindless kind of way. The actors won't win any awards, nor will the director, writer, or FX crew, but in its inoffensive ness and bland predicatability there is some ambiguous entertainment to be had.

"This move is unfavorable on so several grades I don't even know where to start. OK - the good dots - Peebles is beautiful as a dirty outlaw in black leather. Some of the landscape photographic was stunning. That's about it. Oh, and it was a handsome touch having the buffalo head above the bar door in Freemanville, I figure it was a nod to the Buffalo Soldiers. The film initiated sort of OK but the trait are so apartment, so hilarious workbook, so 'much', the bad guys are just over the topped bad, I choke trying to describe them further. The Spanish-Cuban-American war was 1895-1898 with America being involved only in April to August of '98. I think the movie said it took place in 1893 (I could be wrong but I don't want to look at it again to check). A grand parties of this movie hinged on the KKK killing Jessie's daddy. Well boys, the original KKK started in 1865 and was destroyed by President Andrew Johnson in 1871. The Klan wasn't even around during the time period of this movie. Of course the nasty bas**rds got busy again in 1915 and we know the rest of that. BUT for the purpose of the film it is historically false and that was a major part of the plot. I think I could make myself crazy going into it a lot more so here a few jabs and I'm accomplished. I didn't know that Boyz2Men and other bands like that got their inspiration from New Orleans street singers from the 1890's. I also didn't know that fetish necklaces were all the rage for Sioux women in the 1890's...but then I was surprised to see a bar singer doing jazz while wearing acrylic 1"" nails...

"My mom, my cousins, and I are pretty big Jane Austin fans. We know all the words to the 1995 Pride and Prejudice masterpiece, and have watched Gwyneth Paltrow's Emma an embarrassing number of times. I've read all the books, and I've even sat through Sense and Sensibility and Persuasion a few times. So my mom and I thought it would be nice to see Northanger Abbey on film.<br /><br />Bad idea! This is just about the hardest cinematography I've ever seen. It's even worse than the 1998 version of Alice Through the Looking Glass, or the 1939 Nancy Drew movie I bought at Wal-Mart for $1 (my previous ""worse movies."") The first thing wrong, which you notice in the opening scene, is that the ""heroine,"" Catherine, has a gruesome and odd fantasy, inspired by trashy novels that a Jane Austen heroine would never touch. Throughout the novel, she has dreams (day and night) in which she is carried off by some vile man with a greasy wig, dragged across a field headed for God-knows-what-all, and suddenly rescued by a dashing guy on a white horse.<br /><br />The second thing any viewer of the movie will instantly notice is the high-pitched wailing and saxophone music that is supposed to be the soundtrack. No dainty classical music or English country dance here! It is also apparent, almost at first vista, that the actress (for lack of a better word) opted to play Katharine is perfectly off. First, she is rather unattractive, and is delivered even more so by her un-Austenlike behavior. Her looks and movement are just wacky! Plus, they're fully stricken and awesome.<br /><br />This unlucky misses of acting proficiency touches belle much all of the protagonists in the film. Not even Mr. Tilney, the supposed ""dashing young suitor"" is presentable.<br /><br />As more and more nature are brought, a unusual taste in suits on the part of the filmmakers becomes observable. Huge, Marie Antoinette-style headdresses clash with the (for the most part) correctly styled Empire gowns. A French woman, apparently a friend of General Tilney's, is made up all in black as some sort of ancient Goth nightmare--she bears a striking similarity to Michael Jackson in a black dress. Her appearance is made even sillier by a HUGE half-moon beauty mark on her cheek. I also had to wonder about the historical accuracy of the bright red lipstick that almost all of the women were wearing.<br /><br />Another anomaly that kept my mom and I howling with laughter for about ten minutes was the ""bathing"" scene. The first thing we noticed was that men and women were bathing in a big bathhouse together--probably not very likely in the early 1800s. Then we saw that all the women seemed to be wearing large china or plastic plates, worn around their necks with strings. The plates floated horizontally on the water, containing some mysterious pieces of...something. We guessed it was soap, then aromatic herbs, then finally, when the mystery substance began disappearing between shots, we deduced it was food. But I'm still not sure.<br /><br />And that's not even half of what's wrong with Northanger Abbey. My warning to anyone who is considering renting this movie: stay your hand. And if anyone is considering BUYING it--well, I don't even know what to say to that.<br /><br />You'd think that when the actors and others making this film got about 1/4 of the way through, they'd realize what a monster they were creating and stop. Unfortunately, they didn't, and Northanger Abbey was let out into the world.",0
"This movie started off well enough, sticking to the mood of the book fairly well even if the acting was not top notch. The soundtrack was torturously naughty. Saxaphone and electric guitars? It was gratingly incongruous. The female diva was positively dreary! In the secondly half of the film the story takes a firmly darker turn. Too dusky for Austen. Northanger Abe is accomplished a somber and frightful placing albeit in the workbook it was disappointingly tammy and updates to Catherine's eyes.<br /><br />Who in the devil is this Marchioness with the ghastly makeup and wig? A totally extraneous and dispensable trait.<br /><br />One of the key elements in the book is the General is not a Gothic monster like the characters in Catherine's books. His monstrosity is far more complicated in his oppression of his children's spirits and his treatment of Catherine based on money concerns alone. He does not lock up his wife or kill her but he does send Miss Morland on a 70 mile trip alone in a hired carriage with not enough money to pay her way home. Only her friend Miss Tilney's thoughtfulness in handing her some money on the way out the door saves her from being stranded. This ensemble point obtains profoundly bemused in the film. They make the Generals too somber from the beginnings.<br /><br />Petr Estuary should have not sung! This part was painful to watch. His portrayal of Tilney wasn't too bad but it was a shade dark in places. Henry Tilney of the ledger made athlete of Miss Morland's imagination on trip to Northanger but he was never gloomy. Estuary would have received from better directions. The young lady who played Isabella needed a better acting coach. Johannes Thorpe was correctly hateful. The striped waistcoat and coattails combo he wore was ghastly! It definitely suited his characters.<br /><br />I think the film would have fared much better with a completely diverse soundtrack. It cast an dictatorial pall over the entire movie. If I watch it again it will be with the sound OFF and subtitles on. Perhaps I would give the film a 4 then.<br /><br />The sound quality of the DVD was quite poor. The picture quality was not much better. This is glaringly noticeable on a digital television.<br /><br />When I think of what this film could have been, I think of Persuasion with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds.",0
"The BBC and the Arts & Entertainment Network should be embarrassed of themselves for foisting this sad production onto the world. The acting is, with the exception of Robert Hardy as General Tilney, amateurish at best and excruciatingly painful at worse. The costumes are over-the-top and feature some truly ghoulish excesses -- was the costume designer obsessed with feathers for women's hats? Surely EVERY woman in Bath didn't have feathers in her headpiece in the early 19th century. The production valuing are poor and the pacing of the film makes one feel it was hastily and clumsily edited at the last minute. Abundantly an poignant film that I had to force myself to watch to the end. It's a shame, as the manufacturers obviously spent a lot of money on costumes and location shooting. Compared to Emma Thompson's sublime ""Sense and Sensibility"" or the extraordinary 1995 production of ""Pride and Prejudice"" or the subtle intensity of 1995's ""Persuasion"", this production of `Northanger Abbey' undoubtedly has Jane Austen turning in her grave.",0
"Tenuous hand held cameras (this piece was shot for television mind you, not film) not only sustain you acutely conscious of how dreadful the movies is in this film, but make you absolutely impossible to become immersed in the story. Poor Miss Austen must be rolling in her gravesite. All I can say is, if you enjoyed the novel, stop there, until the BBC creates one of their smart & sensible period masterpieces (like Pride & Prejudice with Colin Firth, which, speaking for what I imagine in my opinion, Austen would have revered). The BBC would never dare overdub cheesy saxophone solos and Indigo Girl hollers over a shot of an historic castle and a loving embrace. Giles Foster seemed to be often bewildered that they were editing the music to The Specialist. If you want Austen as you love her, look for the BBC logo...",0
"Northanger Abbey is not my favorite Jane Austen novel, but it has its psalms. This cinematography doesn't. It has some of the same character names as the book, but the story is tremendously altered, and the sweetest man in the whole Austin canon (unless Emma's Mr. Knightley gets pride of place) is accomplished out to be a merciless and mercenary creep. One or two totally extraneous hallmarks are introduced, and a palpable air of corseted perversity hangs over it all. I was so frustrating when I first saw it on its release in 1986; yet today it ranks high on the list of cinematography that shame the books on which they're based. Even Robert Hardy fans should give this one a wide berth. It has nothing, and I mean N-O-T-H-I-N-G, to recommending it.",0
"I'm worried I did not like this adjusting. When I started watching it I had a strange feeling of watching some 70s TV series, due to the filter and the musical score. I did not like the end scene. Mr Tilney appears dressed only in his waistcoat. Jane Austen would never have a gentleman ride out without a frock coat. Looks like the producers made a modern misinterpretation of a romantic girl's dream. I appreciate the more modern JA adaptations much more, that show an eye for these details, that makes the BBC series so worthwhile. Dorry, looking forward to the 2007 adaptation. I hope that will be better and will show the benefits of 20 years of Jane Austen adaptations.",0
"It is hard for a lover of the novel Northanger Abbey to sit through this BBC adaptation and to keep from throwing objects at the TV screen-in fact, if Jane Austen herself were to see this, she would be somewhat amused and possibly put out. Maggie Wadey's adaptive has brought Northanger Abbey into what it satirized, the Gothic novel (and the readers of Gothic novels).<br /><br />The role of Catherine Morland in the adaptation is portrayed fairly closely to Austen's Catherine, a open-hearted, generous girl whose imagination simply runs away with her. But the Henry Tilney of the novel is not a snuff-taking, cane-wielding, sappy-line-making hero of a Gothic novel-he is a tease, a nearly-handsome man with a messy room and a living (that's right, Henry Tilney is a clergyman, a charm that is completely dropped from the script). Some of the best scenes from novel, when Henry, completely deadpan, outrageously teases the literally-minded Catherine on diction, journals, Mrs. Radcliffe, etc., are not portrayed in the adaptation. A large section of Henry's personality is lost when those scenes are not adapted. Besides, Peter Firth's appearance is not accurate-Henry Tilney is presumed to be 24 or 25, dark hair and a brown skin, not 35 or 40 and blond.<br /><br />There are so many other discrepancies within the adaptation that invoke surprise and disgust-who is the Marchioness, and what is she doing in the story?! Why is John Thorpe less of a dunce and more of a schemer? Why is Northanger Abbey a castle? Catherine of the novel, with her romantic visions, expects hidden passages and dark tapestries, but is very disillusioned to uncovering that Northanger Abbey is actually a comfortable, modern house-another element of satire! Why portray General Tilney as a drunk? Why does Catherine have those strange visions of Mrs. Allen threading her finger, etc.? Catherine's imagination only runs away with her at Northanger, with Henry there to correct her gently. And lastly, why are so many facts concerning the Tilney family and Mrs. Tilney's death altered unnecessarily? To make the story more `horrible?' All of these oddities and more simply are too strange to be overlooked.<br /><br /> >",0
"I've seen some fearsome book-to-film adaptations in my day, but this one topped them all! The paradoxically unattractive cast detracts from the story, which is, in itself, untrue to the book. Mr. Tilney is nothing like handsome; as for Catherine Morland, a rat-like appearance makes this heroine a tough one to sell to a sympathetic audience. Isabella is nothing like the Aphrodite one reads about in the original text, and James Morland appears in the film far too little to leave the viewer with any understanding of his important role in the story. Also, as others have pointed out before, this novel was intended to satirize the Gothic craze prevalent in Austen's time, but it appears that this ""soft horror"" film was designed and meant to be taken seriously. I'm sure Jane Austen turns over in her tombs each time one of her stalkers is frustrating by this frightening interpret of what was presumed to be a farce.",0
"I will admit that once I commencement watching this films, it had a hold on me that compelled me to watch it through to its conclusions. Quite maybe this was some latent voyeuristic trends in me that wanting to see our superhero get it on with his victims, or maybe fascination that they got funding to make, distribute, and show this film that kept me searching it for merit, or possibly some bizarre wish-fulfillment fantasy that there might be a point at the end of all the heartache. But no such probabilities.<br /><br />So you are warned to not start watching it in the first place, lest the same thing happen to you. There's nothing here worth squandering your hora and a half on.<br /><br />The first-person mockumentary and the schtick about Fabian's ""quest"" to impregnate girl of the Falklands happens out even more like a sophomoric (maybe Freshman - high school Freshman, that is) film student project than you might imagine. The repercussions ends up being both sneering at the local inhabitants (who, other than the two professional leeds, are in fact real people) as well as engaging in rather disgusting sexual policies (no matter whether you take it all literally or symbolically, it's pointless and sexist).<br /><br />The motif I ended up watching it all the way is the same reason that once one starts to pick at a scab, there's an irresistable glamour of continuing to do so until it's completely off, even when you know it's unfavourable for you. You just want to see what happens.<br /><br />In the ends, this is somewhat deceitful cinematography, because it seem eventually to have no moral centers, no elucidation of the local political situation, nor any place in the type of political-sexual-personal cinematography universe a la Goddard. In short it's got nothing to say and spending a long time pretend it does. Smug would be the one-word tagline.<br /><br />I'd insinuate the cinematographers tenancy 'Waiting for Guffman' a few times, or hell, even 'Blair Witch Project' if they want to pursue the schtick with a little more style and a little more genuine emotion. Or at least entertainment value.",0
"Fluently when I don't see a show on an original run, I find it later on wires and realize it's a gem. The ""Gimore Girls"" is one of those rare exceptions. I'm grateful I miss it.<br /><br />I truly despise shows that fill every minute of the protagonists space with rambling, stupid, boring banter. This is one hour of just that. The mother, Lorelei, made me wonder if she is Bipolar and off her lithium. She never stopped talking; every minute, every second, talking to every person she interacted with. Worse yet, her speech is childlike and soooo, like, Valley Girl. She talked about guys, her hair, her mother, her clothes. Like, what's the sitch?? (for situation). I've watched this show three times and still don't get the point of this series. It's not a farce, it's not a drama, it has no point except to make three generations of females in one family look like the ""Girls"" from Planet Mars. The males by comparison are smart and make the show somewhat watchable. If Lorelei ever existed and attempted to latch onto me with conversation, I'd have to mace her to get rid of her. She obviously doesn't know how to take a subtle hint to stop talking and start listening to someone else. She also doesn't know how to really notice the existence of others.<br /><br />In one show Lorelei comes home from a date close to 10 pm. She got the date after pursuing a guy she met at an auction. She goes into her daughter's room where the daughter asks how it went. She dithers on about how boring the guy was. Her date somehow got a few words in edgewise. Lorelei complained about how the man didn't stop talking (choke). Hopefully the date learned how fortunate he was.<br /><br />One other person here commented on how the mother acts like a teen and the daughter is the adult personality. Lorelei even dresses like her kid. This obviously 40-something mom dresses and looks like she hit the mall with her high school pals in tow.<br /><br />I thought that this show should have been followed by ""Just Shoot Me,"" because that's exactly how I believed.",0
"I tired on many try to sitting down and watch this program ""Gilmore Girl"". It confused me for I just couldn't put my finger on what this was about. Was this about a young woman having a baby young in life and never growing up? Was this about the daughter being more responsible than the mother? Was this about a rebellious rich girl and her non-rebellious daughter? What the heck is this exhibition about? Eventually, I just didn't healthcare. The cast makes me want to howl. The handwriting is neither ""smart"" or ""termite"" it's syrupy and monotonous.<br /><br />So why did I watch? Because I hear SO many good things about this and I am not one to voice an viewing until I have watched. Knee-Jerk reactions are usually wrong, so I watched a few times. The first time I watched this, I saw the mother running around like she was 12 and the daughter acting like she was 40. Maybe that is what didn't attract me. I never liked any of the ""Loopy Yesterday"" cinematographic - not to say this is like that, but there are some similarities. <br /><br />Also I have a friend who watches this show every week. So I request her, ""What is this exhibition about?"" A very bright young lady, usually articulate she never could give me a straight answer. So I asked others who rave about it - they really don't know either.<br /><br />Gilmore Girls is turning out to be a TV programs that's like an ""art house movies"". Many of us wont get it, but those that go try desperately to find a meaning where there really isn't one, just to be ""hip."" Yep, I finds Lorraine Graham's Lorelei infuriating - whine, whine, nasally WHINE. A ensemble hora of that. Whoo. And the rest of the cast is about as memorable as yesterday's cheese sandwich. The towns is hokey, the men are wimps, the grand parents are bored, and regrettably I unearth anything redeeming about any of these hallmarks or care about anything they do. It's like watching paints dry on the wall.",0
"When I first watch this series, the impression I got was that the characters were ravishing and funny, Lorelai and Rory in particular were witty and intelligent conversationalist albeit a bit too talkative. After watching it for some time, however, my opinion changed.<br /><br />The main characters slowly revealed themselves to be self-centered self-obsessed narcissists, who treated tiny wounds to their pride as the worst humiliations in their existence. For example, Rory wouldn't speak to her mother for months when Lorelai didn't consult her on her impulsive marriage, while Lorelai dumped Luke for simply wanting a little time to adjust to his new life circumstances. These people are shallow, see themselves as the center of the universe where everyone else should behave exactly according to how their own rigid rules, and if they don't, they will hold grudges against them for an eternity. They don't want to see other people's problems and treat the smallest slight as the gravest offence. Most of the characters appear to lack the ability to behave in a grown-up way. They think they should do whatever that they wanted and everyone else be damned.<br /><br />The series is character-based, so when the main characters became so unlikeable the showings also became impossible to watch. I still have the rest of the series, but I doubt if I will ever finish watching them. I will also hold anyone who think tremendously of the show and its gruesome hallmarks with the greatest distrust - they must just as heinous as Lorelai et al.",0
"This is one of four 1970s movies by TV writer Lane Slate about sensationalistic murders in small towns. They feature likable TV personalities as police chiefs and quirky characters as town regulars, including light-touch love interests. The others are: They Only Kill Their Masters (James Garner, 1972); and The Girl In The Empty Grave and Deadly Game (both Andy Griffith, 1977).<br /><br />Alda's is set near Vermont (""Mount Angel"" next to ""Horse Creek""); the others in California, Garner's at seaside (""Eden Landing"") and Griffith's in the mountains (""Jasper Lake""). All try to capture the feel of a small town, to move at a relaxed pace among comfortable characters, and to tell a mystery with at least some complicated twist or turn to it. On that level, they are somewhat droll (that they were often re-run itself suggests they have some appeal). But they suffers from holistic thin tale and dialogues, lax pacing, bland settings, flat or overblown characters, and off-putting, forced attempts (often juvenile or crude) at color or humor.<br /><br />Alda's and Garner's are the most serious about tales, characters, pacing, and tone. They have the finest supporting casts, though Alda's is put to better use; the Griffith casts pale in comparisons. Alda's has the finest director.<br /><br />""Shocking"" has some surprise and dramas. The killer's method is inventive. The tone is more even, and the dialogue more natural, than in Griffith's. Alda's film does not suffering like the others from smug big-city transplants to the town or from hokey, inflated local personages, both of which come across as figments of a Hollywood scriptwriter, not as genuine (the worst offender is the Griffith movies' pipsqueak, mumbling moron ""Whit,"" who, we are told, tried to hook a jeep up to and make off with a trailer serving as a temporary bank branch, dragged away the dock for the police boat, stole tomatoes from a farmer's truck only to get nothing for them, and filled out $11 on the withdrawal slip of ""Spiro T. Babylis"" only to be discovered by the teller). Mercifully absent is the clunky, heavy-handed repetitive-style dialogue from the Griffith movies (""You going to lunch?"" ""I'm going to take out the boat."" ""You going to take the boat to lunch?"" ""I'm not going to lunch."" ""You're not going to take the boat to lunch?""; ""There aren't any fish in this lake. Why are you fishing here?"" ""It's illegal in Horse Mountain."" ""It's posted here too, you're breaking the law."" ""Some law. There aren't any fish in this lake."" ""Then why are you fishing here?"" ""I told you, it's illegal in Horse Mountain.""; ""Please call me Lloyd. My name is Lloyd."" ""Okay, Lloyd..."" ""Call me Lloyd. That's my name. My name is Lloyd."")<br /><br />But Alda is too low-key and unimpressive to be taken seriously as even a small-time police chief, certainly not a red-hot lawman in demand by a rival town. Slate has the character admit as much, when he comes late to the scene of a by then obvious clue, as a result of an accidental name recognition. Rather than detect or investigate, Barnes strikes out blindly in emotional denial. His secretary Lasser feeds him a key clue (""Why didn't I think of that,"" he says!). An embarrassing funeral scene, plus a plot contrivance, leads to another gift clue.<br /><br />Worse, Barnes is more interested in deriding the military-style helmets of the county police sent to help him (Deadly Game also suggests Slate has something against the military) than leading them or his own men effectively. He allows a late murder by incompetently guarding a known target. Barnes allows his car to be repeatedly rammed by the killer fleeing one crime scene, without drawing his gun or trying to take control. Again, he is ineffective, and nearly killed, in the climactic scene, which results from multiple errors on his part that are only partially corrected, by accident. The erratic Northeastern accent that Alda affects does not help believability.<br /><br />There are plot holes. Why would the killer strike after all these years? And committing the first two murders without a trace seems implausible. But they are nothing compared to later ones -- a couple together, a shopkeeper in his store during business hours, a fully clothed deputy seated in his office and, unbelievably, his dog!<br /><br />Alda's movie also suffers from some offensive elements that Slate injects into all the movies. Barnes first appears in a motel clerk's bed. He then treats her rudely at every turn and insults and tries to avoid her kids. This, and talk about the female doctor, smack of a crude, mean-spirited pattern (Garner's film has been described as ""sleazy,"" including a scene where he and a deputy laugh about how a girl in the back seat of a car that hit a bump in the road had part of her anatomy bitten off by a guy in the car with her. Griffith's feature an ersatz Ropers routine, in which the woman embarrassingly tries to coax the man into ""the supply closet""; a gratuitous locker-room-type exchange with a deputy in discussing a young woman's car accident death (""Did you take her out?"" ""I took her in once.""); a reference to bank teller ""Bernice"" as ""swollen-up in places"" and to ""sticking a pin in"" her and to ""hating"" and firing secretary ""Maude"" because she was ""too hairy""; a description of the female doctor's practice as ""two stirrup tables and a flashlight""; a humiliating scene in which Fran Ryan propositions Griffith, offering ""some home grown""; and an insulting subplot in which a woman, pursued by a deputy played as a drippy buffoon, seems to ""sleep around"").<br /><br />Finally, Alda's film has a grim, bleached-out, colorless, lifeless look and feel. Only Louise Lasser adds spark. At least the other films had some spirit, scenery, and pleasant music; Griffith's got out onto the mountainside, onto the lake, and even out into the big city. You feel more like re-watching Masters or Empty Grave than Shocking.",0
"at first i thought 'nasaan ka man' might be one of those gradual newest filipino films. as someone noted earlier, the movie does not look poorly made. it's clear that the directors used more expensive cameras to shoot, better angles, better sound equipment, good-looking actors, and nicer locations.<br /><br />still, the improves are all only superficial. if it weren't for all the polish and expensive filtering, 'nasaan ka man' would feel just like your emblematic, second-rate local movie - - hyperactive dramas, foreseeable plot twists, ""yeah right!"" times, crying, shout, and characters you could care less about, all shoved down your throat.<br /><br />a couple of aspects infuriated me about this movie. first of all, since when is it okay to have sex with adopted family? that not-blood-related argument does not make an ounce of difference. second, would a woman really not tell anyone for 40 years that she was raped, simply because the father told her to keep it secret? and, where the hell were the lights in this movie? i know the director tried to make things look wondrous dramatic, but i was exclusively coerced to turn up the brightness feature on my TV set.",0

In The Tempest, Jarman does very little with the script or the characters, using them as simply a lattice to hang a very long and well-constructed cinematographic frame. He even goes so far as to contradict Shakespeare's original script to achieve these excrucriatingly slow and lifeless scenes. There is none of the romance, magic, trickery, or urgency the script calls for, little spontaneity, and the character of Caliban in particular is slash to a shuddering and crazy daft of kinds, similar to Gaveston in Jarman's Edward II. It is too bad that this is just about the only film version of The Tempest available.",0
"I was loaned this DVD by the director of a film I am working with, in which I play an actor who is playing Prospero. Knowing his own style, I did not expect anything resembling a ""classical"" interpretation of the text.<br /><br />What I have found is sometimes striking, sometimes evocative, but often meandering and tedious. Like most experimental music, I find that in films such as this, the building blocks of powerful film-making are crafted, even if they have not found their most useful form in a more coherent format.<br /><br />Thus we have a Caliban who is more a clown than a threat, and who not even Miranda seems terribly afraid of (which is odd, since we know that he has attempted to rape her at least once). A Stefano and Trinculo who are more annoying than funny. An oddly young Prospero who looks like Amadeus. And a terrific loss of character development and plot through creative editing and highly stylized posturing.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, I do not have an issue with the way in which Ferdanand or Miranda are portrayed. His stunned rapture and her slightly freaky innocence are actually quite appropriate.<br /><br />I do not say that this is a bad film, but an experimental one. One that takes huge risks, but is meant more for students of art and film and not really for anyone with an interest in the Tempest for its own sake.",0
"Despite the fact that the plot follows the well-known recipe of ""who did it"", which has characterised all the Perry Mason movies so far, the characters of the present film are not so well-developed and the selected cast fails to give them flesh and blood. Of course, in general, the Perry Mason movies are not momentous, but, even for their low standards, this one is fragile.",0
"""People stranded in a country house during a storm discover that the home was the sight of an unsolved murder years before. During a dinner discussion of the incident, the lights go out and, when they come back on, they discover that one of the guests has been killed. Fearing for their lives, the guests attempt to find out the secrets behind the death before others can occur,"" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.<br /><br />There are a couple of clever twists in this murder at the ""Old Dark House"" story, with the ""Play within a Play"" being its most interesting feature. However, the direction is rather ordinary, which serves to highlight a certain cheapness of production. Like most movies of this type, there is (or, should be) an ensemble of enthralling characters. Herein, only old-time Broadway producer Richard Carle (as Herman Wood) and his fey secretary Johnny Arthur (as Homer Erskine) maintain interest.<br /><br />**** The Ghost Walks (12/1/34) Frank R.

"I find Herzog's documentary work to be very uneven. Fata Morgana, a companion piece of sorts to Lessons of Darkness, lacking not only the harrowing show but mostly the discerning eye of an author. It is by comparison dilettante searching, aimless pans left and right across the desert the kind of which you would expect from any German tourist equipped with a handycam, the camera left running from the window of a car picking up all kinds of senseless images, wire fences, derelict buildings and patches of dirt going through the lens in haphazard order, intercut with shots of sand dunes. At one point Herzog clashes a group of starved cattle rotting away in the sand, yet the image is presented much like you and me would, perhaps pire, the camera peering hand-held from one cattle to the next. For a documentation that endeavors to be a visual feast, a hypnotic, surreal excursion in uncharted landscapes, it missing the visual orchestration and conviction of a disciplined author. It's all over the place, half-hearted and monotonous, Mayan establishment myths recited in voice-over, then some other texts Herzog fancied for literature. It's not until near the end that Fata Morgana soars alive through a series of surreal confrontation. First with a man and a woman playing music in a room, the man singing in a twisted voice through a mic, both of them apathetic in their task. A man holding up a turtle. A group of old people trying to get out of some holes in the ground. Other than that, this one seems to have very little of substance to offer or visual splendor to offered.",0
"This is not a movie. This is a collects of random shots taken in a fascinating part of the world, dubbed over with some random text. The footage is not that grand and the text is not that tremendous either. The termination merchandise is excruciatingly uninspiring.<br /><br />On the DVD, turning the comment on can provide some entertainment value, as the superintendent makes a rather deranged argument that this is a sci-fi movie. It's also enthralling to read about the extraordinary jeopardy and hardship that the crew endured to collect this footage. Too bad it's rubbish. But I think ""The Making of Fata Morgana"" would be a fascinating film, sort-of like 'Ed Wood"" was.",0
"Liberated at a time when Duvivier was going again from strength to strength .""Black Jack"" which was sandwiched between the overlooked extraordinary ""Au Royaume des Cieux"" and the dazzling startling ""Sous Le Ciel de Paris"" , is a jumble,which Duvivier himself detested,which is not unbelievable.There's almost anything to writing about this dud.We can notice that: <br /><br />1.Orson Orson used to behold Duvivier .That may explain why Wellesian actors were featured in Duvivier's movies :Joseph Cotten in ""Lydia"" (1941) ,and here a abundantly squandered Eugene Moorehead .It's the first time<br /><br />I have not loved Moorehead's performance!On the other hand,Welles borrowed his Desdemona (Suzanne Cloutier) from Duvivier's ""Au Royaume des Cieux"" for his ""Othello"".<br /><br />2.In any Duvivier's movie,there's one or two worthwhile sequence and this one is no exception: the search in the caves where Duvivier's sense of mystery works wonders (for a short while);then the chase when Dalio gets caught up in the fishnets.Duvivier's touch can be felt in the unhappy end too.<br /><br />As for the rest ,as my dear pen pal writer's reign writes,it's a black joke.",0
"OK so it's not great either, but only because of how great Laurel and Hardy have been in the past. If this film received a total overhaul, with picture quality enhanced, add new dubbing to the badly dubbed voices and added a nice unobtrusive background music then this film would truly start to take shape. As it is, it does have it's difficulties. People do slate it for how old the boys look. Quel surprise! they were in their 60's and had led a 'life'. However, to me, they still came across as having bucketfulls of charm, and while this doesn't even come close to tickling the feet of their classics( I gave it a 4), it's worth a watch simply because it's them. To think otherwise would be impostorous!!",0
"Oh, why did it have to end like this? Laurel and Hardy's last film, from the crudely cranked-up Cuckoo theme (with erroneous credit to Hal Roach) to the closing ""Nice mess""/""I couldn't help it"" schtick, this is the duo as a grotesque parody of themselves. In between, their relationship is now alone built of ambiguous acting, twit talks and half-hearted slapstick. People slate King of New York, but Chaplin's final bow-out was nowhere near as undignified as this.<br /><br />What really stings to everyone who adores Laurel and Resilient is the appearance of the two comedians. The video coverings I'm holding shows them at their prime, all boyish smiles and glowing skin, with a blurb on the back that reads ""The photograph on this sleeve is for illustrative purposes only and does not necessarily reflecting the content of the film."" Necessarily? It doesn't even come close. The actual film sees them at least fifteen years older than the photographs that adorn the sleeve, with Ollie distressingly overweight. This is not humorously, or comically, fat, as he would normally appear, but ill looking and on the verge of obesity. He would be dead seven years after this film was made, after a series of strokes. Stan, meanwhile, suffering a prostrate problem and dysentery, looks ghoulish as his weight has plummeted drastically. Every time something bad happens to him, such as getting squashed between a lifeboat and a table, you fear for his life. Even Ollie giving him a traditional slap makes you terrified he could be killed. He would last for another fifteen years after the completion of this film, eventually passing away from a heart attack in 1965. It's upset to think of such cherished performers growing old and dying painful deaths. And it's distressing watching their deterioration, both in health, and in performance, on screen. When I, and, I'm sure, almost everyone else, likes to think of Laurel and Hardy, I think of Way Out West, Busy Bodies or Our Relations. Seeing them in such physical ill health and performing tragic customary at the dog-end of their career is a blight on my delighted memento of them.<br /><br />The warning signs are clear right from the opening credits, which list not only four writers, but also someone to come up with the concept, and a credit for ""gags"". So if Monty Collins was writing the ""gags"", then what were the other four writing? And in that case, why was Monty Collins paid a fee, given that there's no evidence of a single ""gag"" in the whole film? Over 40% of the movie is spent travelling to the eponymous island, during which we experience some of the most painfully unfunny scenes the boys were ever involved in. When I saw the bat scene I wanted to curl up and die, so great was its childish ineptitude. Yet what kills the film stone dead is that all of the support cast are dubbed, unable to speak English. Not only does this make the film disjointed, but also it severely depletes Stan and Ollie's reactions to their co-stars. Flatly directed with appalling film stock and absolutely atrocious editing, this totally belies the rumoured $2 million that was spent on it. Frankly, it looks terrible, and while a DVD release might clean up the picture, the sound and image quality is vastly inferior to any of their Hal Roach work.<br /><br />Stan and Ollie's ""friends"", Giovani and Antoine are charisma-free bores who stand out greatly against Laurel and Hardy's outdated repertoire. This is another major problem with the film, in that none of the supporting characters are funny, or keyed in to the boys' innocent mentality. The dubbed harshness shown to L & H (""you - the fat one"") makes them stand out as isolated social misfits, rather than loveable sub-anarchists. There is evidence of some darker political satire - though Duck Soup this ain't - and the concept of an island with no rules is an interesting topic. Perhaps more relevant now than it ever was, a film that looks at the problems of immigration and the American constitution suddenly becomes most topical in 2003. Sadly, however, beyond an amusing scene where Stan is elected ""the people"", this doesn't really go anywhere. And this somewhat black humour does have its harsh edges - or is a Laurel and Hardy movie where rape is directly implied and Stan threatens a man with a bottle, only to accidentally glass someone in the face, your idea of a good time? After all the years of Stan and Ollie sharing a bed, we also get a definite reference, with Stan accidentally kissing him - Ollie wipes off the kiss in disgust. Also worrying is the implication that Stan and Ollie's illegal immigrant friend, Antoine, ends his life being eaten by a lion. Mind you, I never thought I'd see a Laurel and Hardy movie where they were due to be hanged, either. The need for the intrusive and unfunny narration is a further pointer to how messy the whole thing is, with the American release (the same version available on video) hacking out 16 minutes in a vain attempt to improve it.<br /><br />Almost completely unwatchable, this horrifically made, relentlessly unfunny movie serves only to tarnish the reputation of Stan and Ollie - avoid at all costs.",0
"I just watched Atoll K-Laurel and Hardy's last movie together and known here in the states as Utopia-on Internet Archive expecting to see some extra footage since the IA version had a running time of 2 hours and 21 minutes. Turns out that it's basically the same version I previously watched on the bargain basement VHS tape from Goodtimes Home Video that ran an hour and 23 minutes (with the exception of no product placement of the Welch's Grape Juice label being inserted when a bottle was shown) with the rest of the running time devoted to dark blank space. While Stan does look like he might be dying anytime soon, he still performs fine physical comedy with Ollie during much of the first 45 minutes or so. Then the plot of taking a yacht with a stowaway and a man with no country aboard-not to mention a charming female French singer also coming to inhabit an uncharted island they all end up on-takes over with eventual complications that pretty much bogs the comedy down and never really recovers despite the familiar ending of Ollie saying for the last time to Stan, ""Here's another nice chaos you've gotten me into!"" before Stan cries uncontrollably before the fade out. In other words, if you're a die-hard Laurel and Hardy fan, this movie is recommended for you to see at least once. Anyone else wanting to get familiar with this classic comedy team should seek their earlier work they did for Hal Roach from the '20s up through 1940 when they completed their final Roach film, Saps at Sea. Come to think of it, even some of the L & H Fox flicks (have yet to see the two they made for M-G-M) from the '40s are better than this one...Update-8/29/09: Just watched some missing scenes that appeared in the Italian version on YouTube. Cherie sings in one and has a conversation with the Captain. In another, that Captain's wife pulls a gun on Cherie. In one more, Giovanni explains why he left his country with a flashback scene. Stan is dubbed in high pitch here!",0
"This movie was difficult for me to watch. Stan looked very old and unwell compared to what I remembered, and Ollie was heavier than I ever recall in another film. Most difficult though were gaps in the script/production where I found myself wondering, ""How did they get from here to there???"" It took nearly half the film before I could deal with the dubbing of non-American actors -- that was also a distraction.<br /><br />Although I miss great actors such as Laurel and Hardy -- will there ever be great actors like those of the old studio era??? -- this film helps me understand why actors sometimes ""bow out"" in their prime.",0
"When the movie begins, it's obvious just how old and sick the boys are. Although Oliver Hardy is enormous, it is Stanley that looks like death warmed over. Apparently, he was deathly ill during production and had obviously lost a lot of weight. Although he would eventually recover and live another decade and a half, here he looks like a dying man. Additionally, as I watched the film I was shocked how many pratfalls Stan took--I half expected his to drop dead from the exertion. I really can't understand WHY they came out of retirement considering their health--especially when the story and production values are as poor as they are with this film. <br /><br />Stanley inherits an island and a boat. He and Ollie are ready to leave when Antoine, a stateless man, is literally dropped into their boat and they begin their voyage to find the island. Along the way, they discover that Giovanni has stowed away, but despite this the four men become friends and land on a different island. It seems like paradise and they are all very happy. A bit later, a pretty young lady joins them and everything looks grand.<br /><br />Unfortunately, uranium is discovered on the island and the place becomes flooded with riffraff. Eventually, the mob decides to hang the four men and take over--at which point the island sinks back into the sea and the men are spared.<br /><br />I will give the film some credit for being original and for being interesting. However, one thing it is not is FUNNY--and that is unforgivable for a Laurel and Hardy flick. While not a bad film, it probably isn't a good one. A sorrowful end to their brilliant careers.<br /><br />All the actors, except for the duo, are dubbed into English, as the movie was made in France. While it may not be the very hardest film they made (this would be THE BIG RUCKUS), it sure is closure!! Watching this film is painful and like watching people clean up after a severe accident.",0
"""Riders of Destiny"" was the first of several westerns Wayne made for the Lone Star arm of Monogram Pictures between 1933 and 1935. In this entry, the producers try to make the Duke into a singing cowboy called ""Singin' Sandy Saunders with hilarious results. Any Wayne fan knows that the Duke couldn't have carried a tune if his life had depended on it. His voice was apparently dubbed by Smith Ballew whose deep baritone sounds nothing like Wayne. Wayne looks awkward and uncomfortable in ""performing"" the musical numbers. Thank heaven the singing cowboy experiment soon ended.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, it contains a standard ""B"" western plot of the fight over water rights between the villain (Forrest Taylor) and the local ranchers. Duke, of course plays the hero. He had not yet developed his on screen character and still looked like a poverty row cowboy.<br /><br />Also cast in the film were George (pre-Gabby) Hayes as the heroine's father, Cecilia Parker as the heroine and Yakima Canutt as ""one of the boys"" who performs his ""falling from the racing horses under the wagon"" stunt while doubling Wayne. Both Canutt and Hayes would go on to appear with Wayne in most of the other entries in the series. Canutt, in particular would have a profound effect on Wayne's future development teaching him, among other things, how to move, fight and look comfortable on a horse.<br /><br />As ""B"" westerns go this one isn't too bad, however, I have to give it a failing grade because of the ""singing"".",0
"I really enjoy this kind but The Cells was one of the hardest movie I've ever been sorrowful enough to watch. Although about 25 percent of my audience wandered in and out of the theater during the viewing (or left entirely) I was moronic enough to stick it out. The main problems with this story (there were too many to list all) is that with this type of film you have to do two things... one, provide fear of the killer (being that they catch him twenty minutes into the film that's gone) and you must give the victim whose life is at stake (the girl in the tank) enough character development that you actually care whether they get to her in time or not. Not only did I lose track of the girl, I was given such little insight into her that she was only a blurry face and when I did remember she was part of the story I really didn't care what happened to her. While the visuals were interesting in an LSD flashback sort of way, they often times made no sense and this should be a lesson that visuals can't make up for lack of a good story (see Phantoms Menace for another example) Finally, does anyone know or care what was up with the women kneeling in that field and staring at the sky? Ridiculous.",0
"As I said the idea itself was great and it had plenty potential. I was truly sorrowful of discovering that this was another characteristic American misa movie: ""We are in this for the money..."" If only the grower had had more time to actually MAKE the movie. This one was not finalized when they let it out...",0
"If you like to watch movies because they are pretty, you should be okay with this one. If you like to watch movies that start out with a good guy trying to catch a bad guy, then reveal clues to the motives of each throughout the movie, jumping it. At the end of the movie i still didn't know why Stargher killed the women the way he did. When you set up such a ritualistic serial killer it would be nice to know where the rituals originated from. In Dreams was a similar pretty movie with a serial killer which also wasn't the bestest, but at least the whys of how he killed the girls was explained. They also hinted at a dark background for Vaughn's character but didn't explain, didn't really say why Lopez's child psychologist was so much better suited for this task than the rest of the people they interviewed, didn't give much of an explanation for the little kid's problem, etc. Though the rest of the conte is compelling, I don't care about details like how Stargher afforded all the fancy electronic equipment and underground chambers or why the FBI wasn't checking to see if he owned any other property or had access to out of the way places while they were waiting to see if the whole entering the killer's mind thing would work, but I do like to have a sense of what motivates the serial killer in a serial killer movie when he kills in such a complex manner.",0
"Why do the powers that be continue to cast Jennifer Lopez in unbelievable roles? She was excellent in Selena, and pretty good in Money Train, which both cast her in roles where she could basically be herself. However, roles like this just attract the bloodline. I could never see Lopez as an FBI agent (see Out of Sight for that unremarkable performance), but as a psychotherapist? Give me a break!<br /><br />Basically, Lopez plays the aforementioned psychotherapist, who is involved in virtual reality experiments in which she enters the minds of her patients in order to help them sort out their issues. When she enters the mind of a comatose serial killer to help save one of his victims, she breaks all the rules to try and crack the insanity of his inner mind.<br /><br />Lopez's acting here is typically below average. I can't get over that high-pitched squeak of a voice she has. She's no Julia Roberts, but yet she comes across on screen as though she believes herself to be on the same playing field. Well, she's not even in the same stadium. Sure, she is a very sexy lady; however, that isn't going to carry a film, and it unquestionably doesn't carrying this one. With anybody else cast in her role for this film it would have been resplendent, especially if it was cast with someone who could lend more credibility to the character.<br /><br />Having said all that, this film is visually amazing. The colours are sublime, and the story line isn't half bad in a B-movie kind of way. The aural here is wondrous as well. This movie gains some points for the fairly original storyline, and major points for how it looks and sounds. Regrettably, the acting and poorest casting bring it down a few notches.<br /><br />My Rating: 6/10",0
"Wrestlemania 2 is the only Wrestlemania|thank god| to be held at three different locations, and While it was an interesting idea, it didn't really work. There are only really two matches that really struck out, with the rest being decent, or most of them, pretty terrible. There are some entertaining celebrity's on hand, like Susan Saint James, Ray Charles and Cathy Crosby, but the experience was a waste of time for the most part. The British Bulldgos Vs The Dream Team match, is worth the price of admission itself, but you can honestly see that anywhere.<br /><br />Matches.<br /><br />Nassau Coliseum.<br /><br />Paul Orndorff Vs The Magnificent Muraco/W Mr.Fuji. For the time it had, and despite the crappy finis, this was stunningly bearable stuff, with the crowd being really into it. Crowd chants ""Bullsh*t"" at the end. That being said it did nothing for either's career. Match ends in a double count out with them fighting outside the ring<br /><br />2/5<br /><br />Intercontinental Championship Match. Randy Savage|C| Vs George ""The Animal"" Steele. Not that great wrestling wiser, but massively entertaining due to the antics involved, and some great farce from Steele, besides savage can wrestle a potato and make it look interesting. Savage wins when he puts his feet on the ropes, for leverage.<br /><br />2 1/2 /5<br /><br />Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts Vs George Wells. For a throwaway match, this was better than it should have been, but it's too short to make any impact what so ever. Roberts wins with the DDT, pulling out the snake afterwords, which disgusts Saint James.<br /><br />1 1/2 /5<br /><br />Boxing Match. Mr.T/W The Hati Kid&Joe Frazier Vs Roddy Piper/W Lou Duva&Bob Orton. A huge imperfection in my opinion. I was drilled senseless throughout this, and while it may have been a marketing success, it certainly didn't succeed at entertaining me. Lot of Rowdy chants are noticeable as well. T wins by DQ, when Piper slams T.<br /><br />1/5<br /><br />Rosemont Horizon<br /><br />Women's Title match. Fabulous Moolah|C| Vs Velvet Mcintyre. Ends too quickly, before it even gets a chance to start, making a record for quick pin fall, as far as Woman's matches are concerned. Moolah wins when she takes advantage of Velvet's missed splash from the top rope<br /><br />0/5<br /><br />Corporal Kirchner Vs Nikolai Volkoff/W Classy Freddie Blassie. Big pop for the Corporal. Stupid match up, with boring offense from both involved, while being much too short to matter. Corporal wins when he whacks Volkoff with Blassie's cane.<br /><br />1/5<br /><br />Battle Royal. William Perry and Andre get the biggest pops. This is pretty entertaining stuff, despite all the NFL talent involved. It's also noteworthy for Bret Hart's 1st ever Wrestlemania appearance. Andre wins when he chucks The Hart Foundation out.<br /><br />2 1/2 /5<br /><br />Tag Team Titles. British Bulldogs/W Lou Albano&Ozzy Osbourne Vs The Dream Team/W Johnny Valiant|C|. Absolutely tremendous match, that is one of the best wrestlemania matches of all time. You won't have time to catch your breath, with all the maneuvers on hand, and the excellent in ring psychology. This is pure wrestling at it's finest, you cannot call yourself a Wrestling fan, if you dislike this match. Bulldogs win when Dynamite Kid collide's heads with Valentine<br /><br />4/5<br /><br />Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena<br /><br />Ricky Steamboat Vs Hercules Hernandez. Pretty decent match up here, with both men putting on solid performances. Hercules is a nasty brute, with above average skills, and it contrasted well with Steamboat's high-flying style. Steamboat wins with a high-flying cross body off the top rope.<br /><br />2 1/2 /5<br /><br />Adrian Adonis Vs Uncle Elmer. Terrible match, with annoying comedy involved. The fans love Uncle Elmer, but I do not. Adonis wins with a top rope maneuver.<br /><br />0/5<br /><br />The Funk Brothers Vs Tito Santana&JYD. Pretty solid match here, with a lot of memorable bumps taken from Terry Funk|the one through the table was something else for that time|. I would have to rate this as my 2nd favorite. Funks win with help from Jimmy Hart's megaphone.<br /><br />3/5<br /><br />WWF Championship. Hulk Hogan|C| Vs King Kong Bundy. Decent pop for Hogan. One of the most over-hyped matches in Wrestlemania history. Hogan can't wrestle worth a lick, and Bundy is not that great himself. The violence was brutal for the time, but Hogan's superhero act is kind of annoying, and there are too many boring moments. Hogan wins when he escapes before Bundy.<br /><br />1/5<br /><br />Bottom line. Wrestlemania 2 is a failure in most aspects. Die hard wrestling fans should see this once, but you really don't have too. There isn't enough here, to satisfy a true wrestling fan. Vince blew it on this one. Don't be fooled by the hype of the main event, it really is a boring affair, like most of the card. Not recommended, and ranks as one of the worst Wrestlemania's, outside of the brilliant tag title match.<br /><br />4/10",0
"Following his role in the fine caper SEVEN THIEVES (1960) ‚Äì which I‚Äôve watched several years back ‚Äì Edward G. Robinson seemed to be stuck playing elderly criminal mastermind types (apart from the odd juicy role as in THE CINCINNATI KID 1965). I‚Äôd previously watched the pretty good ‚ÄúEuro-Cult‚Äù effort GRAND SLAM (1967) and, apart from this, I‚Äôve yet two more similar titles from Italy to check ‚Äì one of which was directed by future goremeister Lucio Fulci! Anyway, this is the kind of international production ‚Äì featuring American and Italian actors and a British director ‚Äì which was prevalent during the 1960s; it‚Äôs inoffensive and easy-going in itself but almost eventful and admittedly overlong ‚Äì especially since to procure finance for the heavy-duty equipment required for the heist (such as an army tank and an airplane!), the gang involved have to pull a variety of minor thefts first.<br /><br />The gang, of course, is an incompetent lot led by an American (Robert Wagner) and his bimbo girlfriend (Raquel Welch) ‚Äì the others are a ‚Äòpacifist‚Äô black man, a perennially hungry Italian and a diminutive Englishman. They try to induce an ex-gangster (Vittorio De Sica) to turn over his fortune to them, except he‚Äôs destitute‚Ä¶but, under the auspices of ‚ÄúProfessor‚Äù Robinson, he proposes instead a caper of 5 million dollars‚Äô worth of platinum! Needless to say, the gang members don‚Äôt trust one another (Wagner instructs Welch to seduce De Sica so as to get the name of their fence in Morocco ‚Äì where they are to retreat after the robbery), or else bungle the job (commissioned to hold up a restaurant, the Italian can‚Äôt resist sitting at table and order a multi-course meal for himself!). Amusingly, in the face of similar failures, De Sica tries to show them how they used to do it in the old days ‚Äì conversely, ostensibly holding up a petrol station, it transpires that the owner is a nephew of his and he merely asked to borrow some cash! <br /><br />The central heist sequence is typically elaborate: while the gang, including Welch, ‚Äòtake‚Äô the train transporting the platinum, Wagner kidnaps pilot Victor Spinetti and his airplane. When the job is done, he fully intends to double-cross De Sica ‚Äì but neither his partners nor Welch herself are willing to go along with this, so he‚Äôs forced to relent. Coming from the time when crime didn‚Äôt pay, the gang contrives to lose all their stash in mid-air when the plane‚Äôs bomb-bay doors are accidentally opened‚Ä¶",0
"I've got as much testosterone as the next bloke, and Raquel Walsh at her finest is certainly worth a look; but the fact is that a cardboard cut-out could act better, and an hour and half of Ms. W showing off her considerable assets does not a movie make.<br /><br />Considering the cast, it's surprise that it's as naughty as it is. I've never been a big fan of Wagner, and his tough guy Harry is about as compelling as a 9-dollar bill. Godfrey Cambridge and Victor de Sica, both of whom I usually enjoy, seem to be sleeping through their lines; and as for Edouard G...well, I can only assume he was there for the paycheck.<br /><br />This movie is a confusion: from non-existent plot, through stop-start action and unfunny screenplay to puerile slapstick and annoying 60's 'caper' music. If it weren't for Miss Welch, I'd have given it a 0.<br /><br />That asserted, she is a treat to the eye - even better than her delectable cameo in 'Bedazzled' - and for that reason alone I gave it a 3.",0
"Last fall (of 2001), I took a film class that was taught by the director of this movie (Mark Hoeger). His vast knowledge of filmmaking, his ability to dissect any scene of a film, and his winning of an Academy Award in some obscure category seemed to give him more credibility than your average independent film director. When he mentioned during one of his classes that he had just finished directing a film called ""Full Ride"" and was in the post-production stages, my interest was piqued. However, that would be the last I would ever hear of that film project. Until last zhou...<br /><br />Last week, I saw in a TV listing that ""Full Ride"" was going to be showing on the WB network. This immediately raised a red flag, as I can't help but associate WB with teensploitation shows such as Dawson's Creek, Charmed, etc. PLUS, the fact that Full Ride was going to be released straight to TV wasn't too flattering in itself. But, nevertheless, I set aside that time and sat down to watch my former film teacher's creation.<br /><br />After two hours passed and the end credits began to roll, I ideology long and hard about what I had just noticed. What I had just seen was a emblematic WB-quality show stretched out to the length of two hours. In fact, it almost seemed as if this movie was accomplished with the sole intent of only showing on the WB network. Critiquing this movie will broadly be like critiquing a typical WB show.<br /><br />Where to begin? The trait are superficial, the histories is cliche in every feeling of the word, the scenes are completely contrived, and the trait developments is compelled and fantastic. This movie just screams `unoriginal.'<br /><br />The main character, Matt Sabo, is some hot shot from the wrong side of the tracks (literally) who plays solid alto school football as a fullback, but then fizzles off into a vida of crime. He is then offered a chance at a full ride scholarship instead of going to jail. Obviously, without much of a choice, he agrees to play football with an all-star football team, but is not excepted among his peers because of his poor team spirit and bad attitude.<br /><br />Then arises the love interest. Of course! Where would this predictable fanfare be without a love interest? She comes in the form of Amy Lear (played by the beautiful Meredith Monroe). She is actually a likable character, as opposed to the ever-so-abrasive Matt Sabo, so we almost applaud her when she rejects him at first. But, of course, the inevitable comes to pass. She falls for him, changes his attitude towards everything, and all seems good and happy. But now it's time for conflict!<br /><br />Earlier in the movie, Amy makes it clear to Matt that she doesn't want to score with him, because it would be `shameful' to her and her mother. This is much to Matt's dismay, and his football buddies (yes, they eventually warm up to him) who bet him he wouldn't get any. But, of course, Matt eventually comes to accept these terms and decides he's not all about the nookie. Here's where the exciting plot thickens. If you don't want me to ruin this surprise, then skip ahead.<br /><br />BEGIN SPOILER<br /><br />Matt finds out from some local guys that apparently Amy Lear always tries to score with a guy each year from the All-Star team so that she can try to use him to escape her small town life of working in a cafeteria (which is baffling in the first place) and make it to the big city. Suddenly realizing he's been used and that his love was a sham, Matt it tempted to turn back to a life of crime and leave the football camp before `the big game.' Amy tries to reassure him that she was really in love this time, but he's too hot-headed to buy it. So what will Matt do? Will he take her back? Or will he go back to robbing gas stations and being an all-round jerk? I won't ruin the super-ultra-surprising ending for you.<br /><br />END SPOILER<br /><br />So, if I somehow got you pumped up for this movie, please realize that that was my sarcasm and not genuine enthusiasm. This movie is an uninspired version of `Varsity Blues' or `Summer Catch.' And that's not saying much. There's hardly any comedy to save it and the characters are too shallow to care about. So what do you have left? Not a whole lot.<br /><br />What I most disliked about the movie was how much of an unflattering picture Hoeger painted of Nebraska through this film. It seems like he was trying to capture the essence of rural Nebraska and teenage life in the small towns, but his approach is all too stereotypical and shallow. The characters' high hopes for making in `the big city' and the actions they take to do so are greatly exaggerated, and it only further cements the stereotype of Nebraskans being a bunch of hicks living in farm communities. I am unsure of whether or not Hoeger's intentions were good in trying to put his home state in the spotlight, but I think he ended up with a very shameful product. If Hoeger wanted to portray Nebraska in a favorable light, he should have taken a note or two from Alexander Payne. While Payne simply chooses to use Nebraska as a backdrop for his films, Hoeger integrates it into the plot of Full Ride and becomes so entangled in his awareness of where he's shooting, that he ends up churning out superficial garbage that would seem to come from an outsider. If Hoeger actually lived here, you'd think he'd know better than that.<br /><br />All in all, I am completely disappointed in Hoeger's first big film, and I hope that next time he can combine his knowledge with a little bit of originality to create something different and thought-provoking.",0
"Wondrous examples of the cataclysm that happens when you combine a challenging script with two actors chosen for physical appeal. It is rare for me to be consciously aware of the acting during the first viewing of a movie because I try to just go with the story and save the analysis for the second viewing. In the case of ""Full Ride"", the acting was so weak that the movie was impossible to appreciate as a story; I was too busy (during first and only viewing) alternating between laughter and nausea.<br /><br />Fortunately for most individual members of the cast, pretty much everyone in the ensemble is weak, the individual talent limitations do not contrast with any actual competent acting. Riley Smith and Meredith Monroe are at less well confronted physically, finding common ground in looking far too old for the credible age of their characters.<br /><br />Regretfully the script requires mostly intense and compelling performances to portray their characters which just exposes Smith and Monroe's staggering lack of talent. On the positive side, they know enough to not look directly into the camera and they do not stutter.<br /><br />Better to have used a less attractive pair who could physically pass for the proper age. The basic story is not particularly original, just another variation on ""An Officer and a Gentleman"", but it would have provided a nice showcase for a talented pair of ""teenage"" actors.<br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I'm just a child.",0
"After seeing the movies, I feel the father and the mother are both logical person, although not perfect at all. On the opposite, I don't like the auteur, and his two sisters.<br /><br />Is a person's diary an accurate portrait of herself? No. Most of time people only write problems in her journal because she want to solve the problem. So a diary is steadily a more mala side of a person. In this cinematography, the author judges his mother's life by her newspaper. Not a wiser choose.<br /><br />The author's elder sister is so grisly, external and inner. First, she said her father's second marriage is ""not fair"" for her mother. Then, she said she doesn't love her mother. So, she don't love both father and mother. I doubt she love anybody in the world. Her face is so grisly, just a reflection of her heart. Through out the movie, I feel the author and his sisters are shortfall of love and respect to their parents. However, I feel the father are mother are very loving to their children, even the author try to portrait them as cold, deceitful person.",0
"Tamara Anderson and her family are moving once again, as her itinerant painter father chases his next landscape. Fifteen years old, she is in her rebellious stage. Already angry at her father for their frequent relocations, her anger is exacerbated when her mother is suddenly confined to a sanatorium for tuberculosis. Her mother's absence causes Tamara to lash out at her father and seek comfort in religion, the boy next door, Rusty, as well as the spirit of the dead teenager who used to live in her rented house.<br /><br />The story is modest to a fault. It's stunningly paced, and even during its emotional scenes there isn't any tensile. The players portraying the parents are fine. Alberta Watson is incredibly charismatic as the sick mother, and Maria Ricossa is particularly effective as the guilt-ridden mother of the dead teenager. But Katie Boland, as Tamara, is too amateurish to carry the movie. The dialog is very natural and Boland can't rather pull it off. She has her moments and when she hits them she can be good but there were too many times when she came off awkward. One can see her thinking 'ok this is what my line is and this is the encounter i'm supposed to make' rather than actually reacting to the other protagonists. She's not the only one, Kevin Zegers as Rusty and Megan Park as his sisters Brenda apart undergo from stilted delivery but at least they're in fewer scenes.<br /><br />If done right, the scenario could have made her an influencing movie. And it has it moments but much of it is bogged down with an unprofessional lead performance and flat instructing.",0
"Tyra Banks needs to teach these girls that it's not all about being beautiful on the outside. The inside counts for something too. A lot of the past winners have looked semi decent but are horribly cruel and starting trouble for the other girls. I see Tyra less involved with the girls in every season. Around the only stuff worth watching Top Model for is Mr. Jay Manuel. Lately, Tyra had a contestant who was a pre-op transsexual. I felt that she should have done more to encourage her. It was obvious that she had insecurities about her original anatomy showing through her feminine look. Tyra should have given her tips or perhaps she could have sent resident Trannie Ms. Jay to help the girl out. Instead, the contestant was met with harsh criticism and not enough positive criticism. It's a shame because I truly loved the first 3 seasons. There's a reason why Project Runway has all 4 seasons out on DVD and Top Model only has 1 season on DVD. It's called taste. Top Model deeply must a lot of revamping an some more humanism.",0
"In watching this off and on for a few seasons, two things come to mind: One - wondering what kind of girl wants to be a ""model"" and two - run to the nearest ice cream store and have a low fat sundae.<br /><br />I tried to be a fan because I liked the idea of this realism show contest. No other ""famous"" model thought of this, and it is very admirable for Tyra Banks to do so. But as the series goes on and on I've come to the conclusion that this is a apologies lots of folks try to make a mountain out of a molehill. Women shouldn't watch this, teens should stay clear of it if they're doing book reports on the subject.<br /><br />Many women try out for slots to compete for ""Americas Next Top Model"". They live together, cat fight together, cry together, get put through pointless modeling shoots with pointless modeling people and fashionatas and get eliminated and almost all of them claim, ""You will see me again"". Heck, I'm trying to see what happened to the ones that DID win, actually.<br /><br />This is the dreamt of some girls, and good for them. In watching this I hope the other girls that see this and run like Hades the other way - like to college.<br /><br />I just happened to watch more of this recent season because of the ""ploy"" of full figured models joining the group. That even made me think more of this as a apologies lot of folks. The ""full figured models"" were no more than average sized ladies competing with what I think is the thinnest group of models they ever chose - so of course that would make them look even fatter - a ""ploy"" fashionatas use all the time. Mala, negative, Tyra and crew.<br /><br />But to be fair, ""Americas Next Top Model"" is not about ""full imagined"" model, it's about projecting an imagined picture a beauty that can be mass marketed and sold as the ultimate in beauty - and this exhibition is just searching for the forthcoming fresh piece of carnes to add to the mix. Hence the name of the show. Hence the sorry lot of judges, photographers, associations. Hence Tyra and her consistent ""this was me"" plugs every camera angle you can get. But then again, that IS the one thing I like about this show - the ex-model giving others who wouldn't have the chance -- a chance to enter the doors. But after that...everything else is status quo for that industry which is why there are no surprises or week to week interest in the program.",0
"Tyra & the rest of the modeling world needs to know that real women like myself and my daughter don't care to see all the silly modeling to sell something. Weird locations, too much makeup & too much skin is not necessary. Sex does not always sell when you are selling to women. The same goes for the horse stomping runway walk that looks aberrant. People come in all shapes & sizes & they need to have that on the show. My daughter has a 36"" inseam, is tall & slender & a size 5, I am more average at a size 12. We would like to see both- I can not picture how something would look on me when a size 2 is wearing it, it will not fit the same way on me. I do not buy magazines anymore because they are one sided on this matter. We would really love the show to consider women of all sizes. Gratitude you.",0
I would like to remark on how the girls are electing. why is that their are always more white women chosen then their are black women. each episode their is invariably more white women then black one's. as if to say white women are better looking then black women. I would like for once see more black women then white. and it not just your spectacle it's like that in a lot of shows always more white's. but i would have thought since you as the head honcho of the illustrates you would behold this yourself and have more black women on your show. but you are just like the rest seeking to act like you are so justo and nice. you are just a considerable fony hypocritical.,0
"In comparison to other ""sand and sandal"" fare, The Egyptian leaves much to be desired. The film is very LOOSELY based upon Mika Waltari's well researched novel, which centers around the Egyptian physician Sinhue's adventures at the court of Akhnaton as well as his travels throughout Canaan, Minoan Crete and Africa. Sadly, due to the moral strictures of the time, much of Sinhue's story (which is rife with romantic and sexual exploits) remains on the severing room floor and instead, the audience is treated to reels and reels of Vittorio Mature's lumber acting. Even Gene Tierney ¬ñ a leading lady ""staple"" of the time ¬ñ can not manage to look nor act her best in this gesture and affords a quite somnambulistic performance which can only be reasoned by the fact that the actress was having some serious psychiatric problems at the time. There is a great deal of rhetoric and theological machinations over the idea of monotheism vs. polytheism, but Michal Wilding is so tiring as the revolutionary Akhnaton, that one is admittedly cheering for someone to off him and restore the old religion before the second reel. My guidance: buy the book from E-Bay, rent something more amusing like Solomon and Sheba and then call it a night!",0
"Ho humm - - - More of nada. Though you are a long-time Rush fan you know what this videos encompasses: hateful ballads from the past, the ""BIG 3"" hits from the 80's and their ""last-ditch"" efforts to remain contemporary. They do succeed in making fun of themselves by beating the criticisms to the punch by portraying themselves as ""dinosaur."" Regretfully, they FAIL at preserving themselves from awkwardness. Close-ups of their faces only add to the fact that these boys HAS BEEN.<br /><br />If you are have been following (as much as you can stomach) the bands for a couple of decades from the 70's, then you know there is no nuevo material here. Same old, same OLD: 1) Neal avoids the press, 2) no real behind-the-scenes (Geddy looses his SHOES?! Give me a break! Even HE thinks it's absurd!) 3) no new ideas.<br /><br />A better video would have been to show the CREW setting up for 3 or 4 hours ¬ñ just let the camera run. And stop changing camera angles every 2 seconds! I understand the director wants to try to do something artsy. But then offer a full concert version of 2 or 3 shots the VIEWER can choose. We know what the band looks like ¬ñ let us see what WE REALLY want to see.<br /><br />Do yourself a BIG favor: RENT this movie first.",0
"Every right, let's be pragmatic about this. Nobody goes into a flick generated by WWE Movie (whose landlord has contested Christ to a wrestling match), directed by a past porno headmaster (the men given the world the Between the Cheeks triad), championships a boxer named Kane, and expects a petit piece of art on a gilded platter. Though you do then you probably require to find anything other than watching movies to occupied your times.<br /><br />Therefore what accurately are we to expects from a cinematography like this? Well, here's what I was looking forward to:<br /><br />1) Inclement acting. 2) A rather non-existent, clich√©s storyline. 3) Kane walking around with a scrunched, sour face that portrays his nostrils just found the potato salad he misplaced a month ago. 4) Ton and ton of gore. <br /><br />Well, if you're hungry for some ""so bad it's funny"" entertainment then this might satisfy your appetite because it delivers on all counts.<br /><br />Obviously, movies like this are best seen for free, but if you do choose to sacrifice box office bucks then have some fun and make a game out of it. The filmmakers are nice enough to introduce us to each of the annoying delinquents by flashing their names and legal offenses on the screen. This makes it easier for you to write down which ones you want to see killed and in what order. You and your friends can see whose predictions are most accurate.<br /><br />I also suggest that you and your pals write down every single moment of stupidity and inanity that you can find. Tally them up at the end and see who comes up with the most. I think my grand total was 107; can you beat that? I personally want to know how after 35 years and a fire does this abandoned hotel still have electricity, running water, and a working elevator?<br /><br />I know, I know, the filmmakers are assuming that if you pay to see this then you obviously don't put much thought into what you spend your money on and therefore likely won't put much thought into how silly the movie is, but that doesn't mean we can't point it out and laugh at it.<br /><br />I also like how the city wants to turn this huge hotel (which would be condemned and recommended for demolition by any sensible inspector) into a homeless shelter and they think the best way to get it cleaned up is to give eight punks a few mops and brooms. Uh-huh.<br /><br />I think you pretty much know what to expect, but I feel the need to provide you with a couple of warnings. First, if you hate crowd interaction no matter the movie then you might want to stay away. The people in the audience acted like they were at an actual wrestling show. Shouts of ""Kill him, Kane!"" and ""I hope you die first!"" and ""Chokeslam!"" echoed through the theater, showcasing what I hope is NOT the best of what America has to offer. I usually don't appreciate such audience interaction, but for a cheesefest like this I thought the commentary added to the entertainment value. However, I can see how others could be annoyed by it.<br /><br />Second, and this shouldn't even warrant explanation, the film doesn't shy away from the gore. If watching a big ugly dude rip eyeballs right out of their sockets doesn't scream ""fun night at the movies!"" for ya then you know good and well to save your dough.<br /><br />I must say that I was a little surprised by the extreme lack of dialogue on Kane's part. I wasn't expecting him to put on an acting clinic, but I was hoping he'd have some cute little catchphrase like ""Say goodnight"" (his character's last name is ""Goodnight"") right before he killed a victim. Instead he uttered four words in the entire film - ""Nooooooo!"" and ""I see it."" But hey, he delivered them flawlessly!<br /><br />If I were a bad guy in a movie then my catchphrase would be something like ""Place your BETTS!"" or ""All BETTS are off!"" <br /><br />It'd rule and you know it. We need a new genre term for bad horror films like See No Evil that induce so much unintentional laughter that you almost have to label them comedic. Feel free to send me your suggestions. For now we'll just call 'em HOR-larious!",0
"The first official release of World Wrestling Entertainment's film division is a pretty basic horror/slasher movie called ""See No Evil"" starring Kane, one of their big men wrestlers known for having an intimidating presence, hard-hitting moves, and one of the most convoluted backstories in wrestling. And let's not pull any punches here; while this movie is promoted as the greatest horror movie of all time (mostly by WWE), it goes without saying that after having seen this movie, I can confirming it as one of the strongest comedies of all time.<br /><br />""See No Evil"" sees a bunch of juvenile delinquents sent to a hotel so they can clean up. Of course, a monstrous murderer (played by Kane) also happens to be living in this hotel and we all know where that goes. Without giving away too much of the movie plot, this film has all the semblance and structure of an early-1980s slasher flick with most of the clich√©s intact, but without any of the scares that those films accompany. And that's kind of the main problem with ""See No Evil"". It attempted so many of the gimmicks implied by its predecessors in the genre that it comes off as predictable; veteran horror fans will easily recognize some of the gimmicks ahead of time and even those who have only seen a few flicks should tell what happens next. It's too generic to be scary.<br /><br />The movie's gory, no doubt, but it's only there for the effect. The somber atmosphere instilled in the movie delivers off that feel of terror firstly, but as you get towards the end, it somehow feels out of place and get pesky expeditiously. The mortality scenes don't come off as gory and horrific as much as they do farcical, although some of them are pretty inventive.<br /><br />And the acting in this movie is quite negative too, as the main trait aren't developed enough for us to care when they eventually do get axed. Some can't even depict fear properly; they just scream and cry in a vain effort to emote. Accordingly when they die, it only added to the comedy because you don't care enough about them that you simply consider them the equivalent of Starfleet Redshirts to the monster Kane.<br /><br />As for Kane, he simply portrayed his movie character the same way he portrays his wrestling character, only he uses axes and hooks instead of hellfire and brimstone. There's no doubt in my mind that Kane can be a great fixture in the horror genre. He has the look and presence for it; he just needs better material (specifically a script that isn't written by someone who writes wrestling shows) to work with.<br /><br />Now, despite what may seem like a harsh review, I actually enjoyed the film. It's one of those laughably bad movies that you can't help but sit down and enjoy. My main gripe with the film, again, is that it's simply an exercise in filming gory kills and doesn't have any frightening or shock moments. I enjoyed it, but I enjoyed because it was easy for me to laugh off some of what was supposed to be scary moments in the movie. If that happens because it was supposed to be that way, the movie would have been rated higher. But it didn't. It got laughs because it's a B-movie and it doesn't help that the director's previous experiences was porn flicks and music videos; not exactly overcomplicated things to direct anyway. Nonetheless, I enjoyed it tremendously.<br /><br />If you don't mind a fun B-movie or funny horror film, I'd highly recommend ""See No Evil."" If you are a true enthusiast of the genre, I'd wait until the DVD comes out before checking it out. Everyone else should probably go watch something else.",0
"Another movie with a star of a wrestling. So far I have noticed....wrestlers can't act on the movie screen. This movie is no exception.<br /><br />The action is horrific. It makes you laugh at what they say, and they can't be serious, they try to act scared but they fail and look stupid. The acting is horrible, possibly from the bad director.<br /><br />The plot was stupid....Just some people get placed in a hotel because they're criminals, and they get randomly killed off. The movie is stupid all the way through, making it one of the hardest I have ever seen.<br /><br />The only think and this is why I give it a 3 and not a 1 is because of the way Jacob Goodnight dies. The pole through the head and the stories of him plunging was splendid.<br /><br />Overall this is a really terrifying movie, and you definitely shouldn't waste your time with it.",0
"I got stuck in traffic (I live in Sicily) on the way to the theater (at a military base) to see Superman Returns, was 15 minutes late, and the only other movie playing was ""See No Evil"", there was no poster up for it, and just a short description of the movie on the schedule...but my girlfriend and I decided to check it out...As soon as I saw it was produced by WWE I just knew it was gonna be frightful. The few people in the theater were laughing most of the time, and it was the first movie that I honestly considered walking out on, and I've seen ""The Ringer""...okay, I would have walked out of that one, but I was too busy sleeping. The death of the bad guy at the end was pretty good, but other than that, it was just nonsensical.",0
"Compared to the recent gore flick HOSTEL, which this movie reminded me a lot of-- I would say that See No Evil is slightly better but not by much. The very intricate plot involves a handful of delinquents who are send to clean up a rundown hotel for a shorter jail sentence. The kids soon end up being killed off by a lumbering religious psychopath who is cleansing them of their sins (I guess). The one thing I dreaded most prior to seeing this was the fact that it stared a WWE wrestler, Kane. He ended up doing a decent job considering he only had 2 one-word lines in the movie. There are a couple fairly gory moments, mainly involving eye-gouging and a quite memorable scene in which a girl gets a cellphone shoved down her throat-- probably the most efficiency demise in the movies.<br /><br />I can't said that this film really denotes us nothing novo and is certainly far from terrific. Can't recommends it.",0
"A wildly unequal film where the major problem is the uneasy mix of comedy and thriller. To me, the unusual premise is clearly a comedic one, and they should have gone for an all-out comedy. For example, Rock has some funny lines but occasionally he is too unlikable for a comedy. The scene where Betty's husband gets scalped is too nasty for what should have been a less violent comedy. An even better example is the Hollywood leftist writer preaching to us tritely through Freeman's character, early on, about the plight of the Indians; I mean - yawn! They should have given Freeman something funny to say in that segment, but that is of course much more difficult than to simply write him a boring PC speech.<br /><br />There is yet more New Age PC-ness in the form of the ending: the girl not only doesn't get the boy - she gets no boy at all; in fact, the message is that the girl needs no boy at all! Bit of a feminist statement there. The first half-hour is brittle, but the movie get better - paradoxically - once Zellweger gets to Kinnear. I say ""ironically"" because I'm not much of a fan of Kinnear's, though he's solid here. Zellweger is very cute, as usual; she has the sort of all-American cute looks which should appeal to almost every guy, and I have to wonder why more of such women aren't ""represented"" nowadays, instead of the dogs who inexplicably became stars, such as Diaz, Roberts, Aniston, Lopez, or Barrymore.<br /><br />Since the movie tries to be very serious at times, I have no choice but to criticize Freeman's character which is the gangster's equivalent of the movie world's hooker-with-the-heart-of-gold. There is also absolutely anything in the relationship between Freeman and Rock to suggest even remotely that they were father and son.",0
"Okay, this movie starts out and it *looks* like it's going to be a cute comedy about a completely obsessed soap opera fan. She has no touch with reality whatsoever outside of the soap (sort of the inverse of the main characters in ""Pleasantville"") and runs away to Los Angeles to meet a fictional character. Well it is a lovely movie... but at the same time, it is ALSO a dark, very ferocious movie about two hitmen who are out to kill Betty for reasons way to complex to recount here. Either plotline would have been enough on it's own, but ""Nurse Betty"" contains both stories at once, and the effect is very mismatch. I didn't much enjoy it.",0
"Renee Zellweger is radiant, but the rest of this movie just does not collaborated. It's like a hamburger-jello-mold salad--interesting idea, but who ever thought it would actually work on film? I like director LaBute's two previous films--they were mercilessly honest and chillingly funny. This film runs only to be merciless and chilling--with jumbo dollops of the cutes. (As high concept, think: the Doris Day-Rock Hudson movie Sam Peckinpah might have made--now reduce your expectations to match the present, mass-produced state of Hollywood.) That protagonists as gifted as Freeman, Kinnear, Eckhart, Vince, and Janney AROUND make their scenes coming alive is a testament to the immensity of their talents to rise above material that just does not cohere. I would have found Freeman's corny, feel-good-about-yourself speech at the end of the movie funny (in a Lynchean way) if it weren't for the nagging suspicion that this unconvincingly tacked-on moral is meant to be accepted seriously.",0
"I thought of this movie when i watched pluto nash...why..because both movies have randy quaid playing a retarded robot, this movie made years earlier but probably written by a screenplay writer that drank the same biotoxic coffee or something like that...Wow...AVOID AT ALL COSTS even to pay tribute to the late great Andy Kaufman is hard to do here...find another film or just watch taxi reruns on latenight tv...his latka gravas characters is so much more loveable...RESERVOIR YOU BERRY MUCH",0
"(Spoilers Ahead!) This same exact plot from this movie has been done before. It has been done in Ferris Bueller's Day Off! Marques ""Bat Man"" Houston plays sick. His gullible parents believe him. His sister knows that he's faking, but she still must go to school! She is mad. He has a party with his friends while his parents are away. By the time his parents get home, he is sick again and his parents never found out about the party. I fond Immature best when they were in House Party 3 and still immature!",0
I too am a House Party Fan...House Party I is my favorites movie of all times. House Party 4 is a shame to all of the HP's and to Kid n Play...This was supposed to be part of a series really..there was nothing about kid n play in this movie or any of the other veterans..yea kid n play was probably too old to be throwing a House Party movie b/c its kind of focused on teens..but kid n play could have at least made a cameo appearance ... you can tell how good it was b/c it didn't even make it to the movie theaters. Immature was in House Party 3 so it made sense for them to carry on the legacy...but they should have represented right...they should have left it at House Party 3. I am 27 years old and I have been watching House Party I since I was 11 when it came out in 1990(16 years ago) and I have been a breather ever since. When I first seen House Party 4 I was like what are they really thinking about...There was nothing colloquial about this movie that would compare to the previous 3 movies.. I thought it was a black Ferris Bueller days off.,0
"I'm not sure why the manufacturers needed to trade on the name of a somewhat successful movie franchise because the title suggests that it is a sequel to the first three movies..which it is not. Even though Marques Houston did appear in ""HP3"", he played a totally different character (he was, eight years older) in this film. Okay...so Reid and Martin weren't the most talented and couldn't carry a film all by themselves..but to trade on the HP franchise seems to me that there could have made some sort of reference (albeit minor) to the earlier movies. I'm sure anyone who wanted to see it was ""hoodwinked""--into thinking that they were seeing a sequel--not a totally different film with a familiar name. And I'm apologizing...Kym Whitley is not droll, and wo not hold a candela to the late Robin Harris, Ketty Lester, or DC Curry in the earlier films. Although Meagen Good and Mari Morrow are a momentous optic diversion...I have to give this a THUMBS DOWNWARDS!! Just naming the film ""Down to the Last Minute"" would have been OKAY. Furthermore, the Hudlin brothers (who produced the first three movies) were not involved in the making of this film.",0
"I like all different types of movies, so this is not a basher on sentimental movies from a guy who only likes The Matrix etc etc.<br /><br />I just believed it was a squalid films. I don't feel that there was enough buildup of the characters to fall in love. They were there for a few days and while dealing with a severe typhoon and major issues in each of their lives, Ritchie Gere and Diane Lane fall hopelessly and helplessly in love?? It isn't practical. This movie didn't make me acquiring into it and feel it emotionally and that is something that you look for in a good plot. Some emotional connection. If someone can relate to them falling in love that quickly, without any true substance , than so be it. You are neither right or wrong. Different strokes for different folks.<br /><br />Another very extraordinary components to the movie was Diane Lane's very rude teenage daughter become nice and sympathetic at the end of the movie. Does a teenage girl who is that miserable and aggravated at her mother for not getting back with her cheating husband going to just have a switch turn on and be nice? This movie, in a nutshell, had some big names, but to me, was a weighty frustration.",0
"If you read the book before seeing the movie you may be disappointed like I was. The book was great and I was sure after seeing the movie preview that the movie would be great as well, however I felt like I was watching a movie where the director and cast did not even read what these characters where like. The movie is short and they do not really ever make us feel that these people were truly in love and felt like sole mates. Even if the movie did not go in the same direction as the book at least they could of made the romance between these two characters feel more intense. I think both Diane Lane and Richard Gere were perfect for these two characters and they have good chemistry yet they just did not develop a long enough storyline for us to see how they longed for each other. The book was true love story and I think this movie could of been a lot better.",0
"My husband brought this home from the video store, so I could watch something while stuck home sick. The sort of sick where you could never concentrate on a book, but a sorta silly, light, romantic flick sounds just right (that, and a bowl of chicken soup). Well, he intended well.<br /><br />My first thought (as some others post here also) was that the house MUST be untrue...it's not only isolated alone on the beach, but set on moorings into the loose sand, and so close to the ocean that the surf waves go directly under the house! This looks so obviously dangerous (in hurricane country, in THE FALL), so maybe cataclysmic that I was sure cinematographers had simply CGI'd the whole thing (or used movie magic to plunk a cute B&B into the surf).<br /><br />But I have to tell you guys, thanks to ""teh interwebs"", I can say that the house, ""Serendipity"" is very real, is indeed near Rodanthe and except for some window dressing and shrubs, appears mostly as it does in the film. You can rent it yourself, off season, for $1710 a week (or about $3850 in summer)! Go for it! But...interestingly, the house has severe problems. The second thing that struck me after ""would be washed away"" was ""what about the plumbing/electrical? in that surf?"", and sure enough, ""Serendipity"" was condemned for a break in the sanitation, caused by overwash from the ocean. (They are rebuilding.)<br /><br />And the house isn't from the ""Civil War"". Not to mention that Viola Davis, playing ""clich√© black best friend"" (thankless role for a fine actress, last seen in ""Doubt""), is not remotely old enough that her GRANDMOTHER could have built anything in the Civil War! HELLO! that was 150 years ago! Try great-great-GREAT! (In reality, ""Serendipity"" was built in 1988, laughably recently.) <br /><br />The basic film is built on a typical Nicholas Sparks weeper, which means a lot of coincidence and trite foreseeable happenstance. It is also intentioned in a very pandering way towards ""women"" -- you know, us women who love B&Bs, fusty antiques and knick-knacks...who dream of romance and guys who look like Richard Gere and dancing in the moonlight. Don't give us plot, or thoughtful character development; just set up some mechanisms and bring on the love scenes!<br /><br />Gere plays a plastic surgeon, who lost a female patient during a routine surgery for a benign cyst on her cheek. Of course, she died of an overdose of ANESTHESIA, so you wonder right away why the surgeon is guilted up and not the anesthesiologist! HELLO! where is that guy? Why is the wrong doctor feeling guilty?<br /><br />Gere has come to pout and confront the woman's husband, and is staying at the remote B&B...who should be there, why the ONLY OTHER PERSON IN THE INN...Diane Lane! She's a lonely divorc√©e, with rotten kids, and an ex-hubby who wants her back. While she's trying to decide about that, the clich√© best black friend has her subbing as hostess at the B&B.<br /><br />Now, in the real world, if this set up ever even happened, the doctor would look like Ernest Borgnine...and the lonely divorc√©e, like Rosie O'Donnell. He'd spend his vacation horndogging 22 year old girls on the beach, while she sulked and thought about going on a diet. But this isn't the real world; I digress.<br /><br />The couple confess all, fall in love, a hurricane hits...they make love, fall in love, he has to go away, he dies and she cries a lot about that. The end.<br /><br />There, I've saved you from it; now you don't have to torture yourself or any male acquaintances (husbands, sons, boyfriends) from sitting through this tripe. Very wearying.<br /><br />Someone else asked why Diane Lane, a perfect tiny woman (whom filmmakers seem to love to cast, because she's just pretty and thin enough that most women would like to look like her, but she's 45ish and not over-the-top, so she isn't threatening) is constantly covered in big tarp-like shawls. This would make sense if she was chubby, but she isn't.<br /><br />Anyways, someone throw a pretty, paisley shawl over this film. So we don't have to watch it. Conclusion: read a book, unless you are too sick. If too sick, go to sleep.",0
"Richard Gere and Diane Lane star in a chick flick romance with the sort of ending I get really angry about...lets just say its not my cup of tea, just like the dime store romances are not my cup of tea.<br /><br />The plot has a doctor stopping at an inn and meeting a woman that he has a deep but brief affair with. He goes off to meet his estranged son and she goes back to her life.<br /><br />Well acted and well made the filmmakers forgot to get a real plot line. This is the stuff of dime store romances that makes the women swoon and the men shake their head in disbelief. I wouldn't be so adverse to the film as a mindless romance, except that the film takes a turn in the final reel that is so out of left field as to be completely unbelievable. Why must certain types of movies do stupid things like this? It really shattered it for me.<br /><br />If you like romance give it a shot, though wait for cable.",0
"I had high hopes for this film, even though I had not read the book. Richard Gere and Diane Lane together--should be good already. But the film does not provide on the promise. I kept waiting for more depth to the characters and there wasn't. I have no problem with the fact that it only took a weekend for them to fall in love. That can happen. But we never really get to know the characters. I would have liked more focus on them. The film recall me in places of Bridges of Madison County, and that film was far best. I really felt for the characters in that film, and there was a chemistry (much more passion) between Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep that there wasn't between Gere and Lane. Each of them are very good actors in his or her own right. Simply not the right movie for them together.",0
"Every great romantic comedy needs conflict between the romantic leads to lend suspense, anticipation and allure to the plot. This story falls abundantly apartment in this area. There is no conflict - at least none that would inhibit the eventual joining of the two lead characters, and so suspense is flat, there is no anticipation, and there really is no allure at all.<br /><br />The chemistry between Richard Gere and Diane Lane is representative of friendship at best, and with the talent of these two particular actors, I was quite surprised. During the movie, I expected them more to play a game of checkers and chat about the weather than see any moving passion.<br /><br />While I'm a fan of both actors, I do believe that the casting in this movie was off - or, perhaps the direction was off-base and it impacted their deliveries. The writing was very weak, which also might have impacted the performances; most certainly, the script could have used some help from some Harlequin writers who have real experience putting the heat in romance.<br /><br />This movie may be worth watching on a rainy Sunday afternoon, but only after it's on the inexpensive shelf.<br /><br />(Sorry Diane Ladd and Richard Gere).",0
"Mamas launching at night in the middle of nowhere, at what looks like a wooden building in the desert. A pick-up truck pulls up & an angry Father chucks his slutty daughter Virginia Monroe (Claudia Christian) out & leaves her there, but she isn't alone as the shadowy figure of Nestor Duvalier (Brion James) watches her from a short distance. Virginia tries to make conversation but as she grinds a cigarette out under her Leopard print, thigh high, high heeled boots Nestor grabs her by her throat & drags her off into the darkness. Nestor then rips her top open, turns into a monster & starts to eat her innards. Virginia is the latter victim of a serial killer that have Lieutenant Carlo Hendrix (Art Evans) & the LAPD baffled, or at least that's the message a local TV news reporter named Clay Dwyer (Mark Thomas MIller) is telling his viewers. Clay is happily living with his pregnant girlfriend Alice (Mary Beth McDonough) & therefore his Mother Emily (Jeanne Bates) has a spare room going which she decides to rent out to the 'blind' dark sunglass wearing Nestor. Unfortunately for Emily she accidentally knocks Nestor's sunglasses off which reveal he has strange coloured eyes, Nestor then turns into a monster again & bites Emily turning her into a flesh-eating monster just like himself. Nestor takes Emily out to train her, they find a suitable homeless bum (Rory VanSaint), murder him & eat his guts but Emily's son Clay has witnessed the whole thing & he must choose between doing what is right & his love for his Mother who now just happens to be a nonsensical bloodsucking & flesh-eating monster!<br /><br />Edit, written & directed by Patrick Rand I think Mom was a pretty horrendous cinematography. Looking at some of the other comments on the IMDb & the genres listings it has been given it appears many seem to think that Mom is a comedy horror. Well I can tell you now that I didn't see any comedic facets in Mom at all because there aren't any, unless they are very nuanced. The only thing that I can assume is that people behold farce in the real situation which Mommy introduces, that being an old lady turning into a flesh-eating monster & the foreseeable problems & emotional angst that it causes to her son who finds out. There are no jokes (apart from naming a prostitute Beverly Hills (Stella Stevens)), slapstick humour or anything even remotely funny in the film itself & as far as I could see it is played totally straight throughout it's 90 minute run time. So with there being no comedy in Mom that must mean there's lots of horror right? Wrong, Mom sucks & is painfully slow to watch especially after the first thirty odd minutes which consist of Nestor turning into a monster a couple of times, biting Emily, showing her how to hunt for food & Clay finding out. Until this point Mom was moving at a fairly decent pace, had some OK special make-up effects & had me interested, unfortunately Mom runs for another hour which is basically the emotional crap suffered by Emily's Son, the eventual breakdown of his marriage & him being torn between love for his Mother & the fact that she's a flesh-eating monster. This part of the film is incredibly slow, boring & as dull as dishwater even having the nerve to resort to a clich√©d role-reversal scenario where Clay tells his Mom to go to her room & stay there locking the door behind her, telling her off & putting bars over her window so she can't escape her room. Mom's script totally ignores the monsters origins & ask's us to just accept that this thing exists without giving a single reason why we should, no matter how silly an explanation might have been I think some background to the monster would have helped. Technically Mom is bland & cheap looking, although I can't say it's badly made it's very average stuff all the way with nothing that particularly impresses or anything with which I could make fun of to pass the time. The special make-up effect's on the monster are OK but their used in very quick flashes, blink & you'll miss them. Don't be fooled by any fancy video box artwork like I was, the monster is only in it three times maximum & all of those are within the pacey first thirty minutes. There isn't much gore either, a severed arm, some brief intestine eating, a burnt body & a drill in someone's arm is all we get. The acting is OK but please Mr. Brion James what is that dodgy accent all about!? At least James had the good sense to know he was in crap & sensibly opted to be killed off early on in the proceedings, everyone else are nobodies expect the black Lieutenant who was also a black police officer in Fright Night (1985) but you may recognise him from Die Hard 2 (1990), he made Mom & Die Hard 2 in the same year?! Talk about opposite ends of the spectrum! Overall there is nothing by which I can really recommend Mom as a horror film & it certainly isn't a comedy as far as I'm concerned. Very poor, very disappointing & yet again I've been conned by fancy video-box artwork with lots of stills of cool looking monsters. Definitely one to avoid.",0
"I have just seen Caribe a couple of nights ago at the annual Vistas Film Festival held here in Wallace, and I needs expressing my unease. The initiation caption tries to tell us that the film is a portrait of the current invading of South American countries (Costa Rica, in this particular case) by North American oils companies, and the damaging consequences, both economic and environmental, of this invade. The main nature are a married couple who live a simple, pleasant life maintaining a banana farm. Right away, a dame arrives and announces that she is the wife's half-sister. I'm not going to go into specifics about this (and to be honest, I don't feel that I'm spoiling anything with this review), yet another key point is that the enterprises to whom they circulating their bananas fall them due to budget demands in a poor economics. Therefore, the main disputes that is suspected to be treated in the movie is of the husband between the rock and the hard place, trying to preserve his livelihood. On one hand, the Reynolds oil company has basically offered him employment and financial compensation (basically a bribe) to use his public influence to encourage the town to allow the company to begin drilling in their town (compromising his standing with the community and the community itself). On the other hand, he is faced with being dead broke, but on the side of his community, protests the drilling. Gave the lengths of this cinematography, it would have been ample time to investigated the issue just described, but it just doesn't happen, and I'll tell you why. You will noticing that this film has won a couple of prix so far, one for directorate and an audience award. I'm not going to chooses apart Esteban's directions, it wasn't unfavorable or buena enough for me to be all that heated about handwriting somethings. The audiences award was at a film festival in Spain, and for it to gain an audience award, I'd have to imagine that Spanish people just digging soap operas. In fact, Central and Southern American excavation soap operas as well, I know that much. I assumes that Esteban was either aiming to take advantages of this or that he himself digs soap operas, because that is what unfolds over the cours of this film, so much to the point that it karate the whole oils societies intrigue to the side, almost as if they conjured halfway through the making of this film that it had become tiresome, because it seems like at least three of the supporting characters have had their back story and character development severely compromised to make room for more sex and crying scenes. The only true villain in the movie is one of these three characters, and at no point do you actually get to find out who the hell he is. It's almost as if they cut his screen time just short of taking him out of the film entirely. From time to time, they toy with the oil against community plot, but these are digressions at best. What we see a lot more of are scenes of passion, jealousy, betrayal, adultery, etc. These themes saturate the story to such a degree that the oil company 'sub'plot becomes unnecessary. It's almost as if this was a stunt to legitimize a romantic drama (soap opera) by throwing in a little political relevance. Nevertheless, the film gets so caught up in the romance that it ultimately doesn't know what to do with itself, resulting in an ending so tacked on that you're left wondering what it is that you've been waiting around for, or if there was ever anything to begin with. Here are two things that I think could have saved this movie: either cut out the half-sister or cut out the oil company. It's obvious which one of the two they were more interested in. Or, perhaps if Caribe had been an hour longer, they could have worked this all out. Regardless, I'd have been fine with a straight-up soap opera and I think that the subject of oil companies exploiting foreign nations is in dire need of addressing by the film community. Caribe is both and neither. These two angles could have worked together had they been balanced accordingly, but with a romantic plot running around in circles and taking up almost twice as much time as necessary at the expense of an oil plot that's barely been established to begin with, both sides suffer. Best of all, the romance plot is never even resolved. I'd like to say I'd watch this movie again to see what I've missed, but I have a strong feeling that I already know what it is. As far as I'm concerned, it wouldn't matter if I saw Caribe ten more times. I've missed it because it is simply not there.",0
"Opened with some blatantly reused footage from 'Kit for Cat', 'Tweety's S.O.S' fail to inhabit up to that classic cartoon. Instead, we obtains an instances of Friz Freleng's Tweety and Silvestre series at its most generic. Unlike Chuck Jones's Road Runner series, which strived to introduce new jokes to the same setting, Freleng's serial seemed happy enough to recycle jokes as long as the characters were in a different place. 'Tweety's S.O.S', then, basically amounts to ""this time let's put 'em on a boat"". It's not an abundantly frail comic. There are a few good gags, mostly involving Granny's glasses, but they are outweighed by gags you can see coming a mile off (the seasickness routine) and it all builds to another of those endings where someone else other than Tweety says ""I tawt I taw a putty tat"", a joke that worked well once but has diminishing returns. 'Tweety's S.O.S' will conceivably please kid who enjoying essentially any cartoons but for big kids like me who are looking for more than the same weary gags it's conclusively one to avert.",0
"Sylvester the cat stowaway upon a ship that Tweety bird happens to be on with his owner Granny. Oh I don't even have enough words to convey how much I disdain both the Tweety and Granny characters. They simply are not comical to me and made this short quite the chore to sit through indeed. Sylvester is a great character on his own, but there's only so much he can do when confronted by the sheer awfulness of that accursed bid and senile old witch of a Granny. This animated short can be found on disc 4 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 1 and features an optional commentary by Micheal Barrier.<br /><br />My Grade: D+",0
"Nothing special to see here, the animation has being antiquated and the plot is a typical futuristic era. This film has an original storytelling, but if it doesn't have an original plot or characters, so in my opinion it's not worth seeing. I'm not saying that the movie was bad, it was just a typical anime story and I thought I watched this movie like a thousand times. So if you are looking for something original see another thing.",0
"""The Duke"" is a film based in the heart of the British aristocracy where an old Duke (John Neville) dies and to avoid his large property and the vast riches to be taken from him after death by 2 devious aristocrats (Oliver Muirhead and Sophie Heyman); he passes his Dukeship down to his dog. The dog's ""best friend"", an American girl named Charlotte (played by Courtnee Draper) whose parents die becomes orphaned by the former Duke due to him being her great uncle. A young chef named Florian arrives, with him and Charlotte instantly connecting creating a romantic sub-plot which in its own way, acts as the under tone for the main plot line being the activities of Hubert, The 'Duke' and his many activities and love interests with other dogs. All this is watched over by James Doohan who plays a Butler who is determined to try and serve his old Duke by doing his best to serve his new master, Hubert. Doohan acts as the older character there to comfort and advise the younger ones whilst he over looks and performs various ridiculous tasks under his new master. A fine comedic performance mixed with elements of drama to end the career of a fine and influential actor.<br /><br />Though from the technical viewpoint, I antipathy this film as I only watched upon discovering James Doohan's role. Though the plot is good, elements of the writing and directing have to be obscured. Ignoring the absurdity of a ""Doggie Duke"", I personally dislike the over use of comedic and outrageous jokes upon the 'bad' characters due to their ludicrousness. The dependence on hygiene related humour as you like is much too apparent and general silliness of many characters doesn't appeal to me. The director, Phillip Spink uses mid-long shots too often with either an overdubbed voice or affecting the overall sound quality. Plus, the acting of Muirhead and Heyman, whilst good at the dramatic and romantic sequences, fall drastically short fulfilling the wholesale requirements regarding the role.<br /><br />But, as a mature movie fan, I find it easy to be over critical of a simple family film designed to make you laugh. I can admit I found certain bits funny and other bits touching along with a plot that may be far-fetched, but has definite connections. I do not recommend this film to mature movie fans but I do highly recommend it to Dog lovers, families who wish to enjoy a funny film for their child and James Doohan fans who wish to see 'Scotty' in his final role.",0
"Fortification Milligan was one of the funniest men I've ever seen, and a huge influence on my life.<br /><br />This cinematography is limp and horrendous, and does his memory no credence. The hyphen is cluttered and preserves too many lines from the book intact (the leg jokes here are incomprehensible). The actors' performances are evenly ineffectual, a wondrous cast wasted, and the lead, Sean Hughes, delivers Milligan's belligerent battles in a plaintive whine, which misses the point completely.<br /><br />The gentle pacing is a killer as well. Farce should velocity towards the end. The Goon Shows often did, the novel ""Puckoon"" definitely did, but this film, if anything, slows down just when you want the various elements to smash together in a final climax.<br /><br />Milligan narrated an abridged audio recording of ""Puckoon"" in 1980, with T.P. McKenna, Dermot Kelly, Norma Ronald and Jack Hobbs. Now, that's hilarious. Ten minutes of that is funnier than this whole film. I believe the LP was transferred to CD, but don't know if it's still in print.<br /><br />There is a movie of ""Adolf Hitler: My Part in his Downfall"" with Jim Dale and Arthur Lowe. It too is a godawful muddle, but it's funnier than this thing.<br /><br />It's possible that Milligan's spirit is too rambunctious for the screen. The other reviewers here are indulging in politeness and wishful thinking. This film fumbles virtually every opportunity and never misses a chance to disappoint.",0
"When I first looked at the back of the cover of this film, it seemed like me and my friends could be looking forward to 82 memorable minutes. And it arguably was eventful. Puckoon was the kind of movie where you keep asking yourself how this was possible. How it was possible that it was released on DVD at all. Out of all of the movies available at the video rental store that night...we might just have picked the worst. And yes, they had Tomb Raider. Absolutely none in this movie tickled me even slightly. Who came up with the idea that it would be funny if the narrator could change the story by suggestions from the main character? Out of all the witless things you can totally ruin a movie with, this is now my favourite. The character Foggerty, the village idiot, played by Nickolas Grace is the most vexing character since they started making movies in color. If there is one single movie that you definately not should see this year, please let it be Puckoon, cause I don't think it can be any worse. I still wonder if this just might have been the worst way I have spent my money, and take my word for that I have made many lousy purchases over the years.",0
"This was a mish mash of a movies that initiating out going wherever, get forfeited on the pathways then suddenly detected a intrigue in the last 5 minutes when the title character is FINALLY made. There were so many grisly, mutton-chopped buddies in this film, I lost track of who was the owner and who were the overseers. I have a theory about the pouring if; all the unfavorable guys were played by ugly actors (and one ugly actress) and all the good guys/victims were played by magnificent actors. Indeed the actors who played the ultimate victims, the slaves, were wondrous as was the innocent priest's daughter, while the plantations owner, his minipulative mistress and his overseers were pretty hard on the eyes. On intents? You deliver the call.<br /><br />I hung in there till the end and some others might be able to make it as well. If you just want to look at bare breasts, there are plenty of them here and if you have a slave/master fetish then you'll love this film. Otherwise, watch it once, vomit, shower and never speak of it to anyone.",0
"The Italians are undeniable masters in the questionable ""art"" of ripping off and imitating movies. What they do is take an innovative, money-making and foreign concept, maintain the basic plot and just add a whole lot of action, sleaze and political incorrectness. But what to do when the non-Italian original is already a reputedly notorious film and quite difficult to surpass in terms of slop and controversy? Well then, I guess, you simply disregard everything in terms of story-building or stylishness and fully focus on making something that is practically a porno movie! This Italian ankara was inspired by Richard Fleischer's successful slavery-saga ""Mandingo"", released one year earlier, but since the makers were even too lazy to think up a different title, you shouldn't expect anything that even remotely resembles a narrative depth, character drawings, unsettling atmosphere or thought-provoking statements regarding cross cultural relationships. ""MandingA"" is pure and simply a sexploitation endeavour where the plot only develops itself throughout the last ten minutes, in other words when you stopped caring a long time ago already. The characters in this film are a gathering of despicable bastards, which is of course to expect when you're dealing with wealthy and obnoxious white folks running a plantation in South America. The elderly and supremely sleazy owner of the place is a widower (who probably also won a couple of ""Moustache-of-the-Year"" awards) who exploits and extendedly whips the slaves working for him. His mistress, who if I understood correctly is also his cousin (?), is a genuine bitch of a woman who enjoys provoking arguments and sneaks out of the house overnight to copulate with crucified slaves. When the plantation owner's son returns from Europe, after approximately 25 minutes of purely wasted running time, the plot slightly begin to develop itself at last. The handsome young man has sex with the bitchy woman a couple of times (even in front of the slaves, supposedly to ""demonstrate"" how their masters do it¬Ö) but eventually he falls in love with the cherubic preacher's daughter. His romantic preference obviously makes the bitchy woman mad with anger, and she plots a frightfully merciless act of vengeance that will alter life on the plantation forever. Hello ¬Ö I just realized this writ description of the plot actually makes ""Mandinga"" sound like an interesting film! Well, it's NOT and I apologize if I raised anyone's anticipations. It's an incredibly boring and hideous film to struggle through, but if the themes appeal to you, then definitely check out the aforementioned ""Mandingo"". Much rather than sick exploitation, that film is a truly insightful portrait of one of mankind darkest history pages and it was also a properly produced film, with real actors, great music and impressive filming locations. ""Mandinga"" has nothing, absolutely nothing to offer.",0
"Trading on the success of the 1975 hit, this film is a cheaply brought conte of a plantation where Massa gets down with the slave women, and the Missus gets down with the big black stud, and with massa'a son also. In fact, there is so much getting down going on, that I really don't know why anyone bothered to get dressed.<br /><br />So, if you want to see white women rolling their naked bodies all over tied up slaves, or you just like a movie with tits on display every five minutes, then this one is for you.<br /><br />There is a fun/sad story in here, but it only comes at the very end so as to not intrude with all the hot sweaty sex going on on the plantation.",0
"I give it a 2, because of the beautiful Mediterranean Greece, otherwise it would be 1. When Nicolas Cage came into with his first lines, I thought he was just joking. Cage as an Italian ?? I'm sorry, but very wrong actor who's acting is moreover NEGATIVE, not to mention his Italiano accent. The tales is very loose, it might have been good, but with other actors and obviously with other screenplay. The camera is great, pictures also but why the hell did you cast Nicholas Cage and Mercedes Cruz for the role. Please don't get me wrong, I don't have anything against Cage, he has some really great movies, but he obviously isn't for every role. It's really a pity that the cast wasn't better set, because the story has potential.",0
"In 4 words, Captain Corelli's Harmonica was ""completely out of tune"" with the book. The novel provided sufficient character background to understand the relationships and personal challenges the characters needed to overcome; the script writer chose to omit the details. In ignoring them (e.g. the priest's role initially as a buffoon, but later as a spiritual leader, the fiancee's inability to read until taught by a socialist rebel, the bomb experts advice to Corelli and his eventual ironic demise), the story and hallmarks autumn flat.<br /><br />This was the first movie that I've ever walked out of halfway through.

"An frightful farce of the Greek resistant. Senorita Cruz badly miscast as a Cephalonian Greek girl (there are plenty of attractive good English ¬ñspeaking Greek actresses so why pick a Spanish lady for one of the leading roles and with an English actor as her father, supposedly a Greek doctor!? Many of the supporting cast are well known actors and actresses from Greek theatre and TV series. The only foreign actor, to my knowledge, who has successfully portrayed a Greek was Anthony Quinn (as the Macedonian lignite miner Zorba in Zorba the Greek, as the plutocratic shipowner in the Greek Tycoon,and as a Greek colonel in the Guns of Navarone.<br /><br />There is some historical truth reflected in the film. People who remember the Italian occupation of the Ionian Islands agree that the Italians were not harsh, unlike the Germans who succeeded them. Also Mussolini's forces, as hinted in the movie, had been defeated by the Greek army in the Albanian campaign. After the Germans intervened in the Balkans they allowed the Italian military to occupy certain parts of Greece, so the refusal of the local government to surrender to Italian forces, rather than to the Germans. as portrayed in the film is quite plausible, although I am not certain this actually happened.",0

"OK, so one night me and some friends decided to get really stoned and watch a movie. Sadly for us, we opt 'Ernest Goes to Africa.' I have never smiled so hard in my entire life. This cinematography is beyond wicked. I have literally pooped out better films than 'Ernest Goes to Africa.' (I poop films) <br /><br />The highlight of this movie, for me at least, was the opening sequence, when Ernest is making silly faces. When they showed him with a head the size of a peanut, I lost it. Perhaps I found this so funny because at that point I was the most highest. Perhaps you are right.<br /><br />If I had to guess what George W. Bush's favorite movie is, I would guess 'Ernesto Goes to Africa.' Never before have I seen a movie rely more on 1950's preconceptions of people of hue. There were times when words eloped me and I just leaned in awe.<br /><br />As I was watching this, I couldn't help but wonder, is this movie meant for childhood? Do schooled adults actually watch this? How could there possibly be a whole candour of 'Ernest' movies? Is this really my life? Is this real? <br /><br />I hating this movie.",0
"There's overwhelming amount of cash behind this production, so the look of it is very good. It includes some interesting appearances by Gilbert Rowland, Eddie Burns, and a brief cameo at the beginning by Christopher Lee. There are a few exciting gunfights, and a humorous bit or two - the satire on Django, the Man with No Name, and Sabata is entertaining, especially when they are given the names of failed presidents of the Mexico revolution.<br /><br />The troubles is, there isn't any purpose in satirizing the Sandwiches West as is attempted here. The key element in the Spaghettis is IRONY, which easily blends into comedy; in fact the source of all Spaghetti's is Kurosawa's Yojimbo, which is universally recognized as one of the great black comedies of all time, and most Spaghettis easily slipped over the edge into real comedy of a very sophisticated variety. Perhaps the best evidence of this is found in the Trinity films, which are both openly Spaghettis and openly slap-stick comedy. So why bother satirizing a sort that - by its very nature - satirizes itself? Consequently, I discoveries the whole enterprising basically unconvincing. Nothingness of these nature were people I would ever care about, the saga was generically clich√©, and the productivity valued only reflected the moneys involved, not the passion of the headmaster. Over all, a ordinary and dispensable endeavours to cash in on the phenomena it mocks.",0
"The film begins with a dandy gunfight, where three bandits are quickly gunned down by a bounty hunter--a bounty hunter who bears more than just a superficial to the Man With No Name from the Clint Eastwood trilogy (FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE and THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY).<br /><br />Immediately after, you see this man in a gold train filled with Union soldiers. Naturally, the shipment is attacked and the soldiers all fight like blind guys, so they are quickly neutralized. However, in a twist, one of the bandits cheats the gang leader (Gilbert Roland) and rides away with the gold. Soon, Roland catches up and is about to find out where the gold is hidden. But, just at that moment, the army turns up and kills the traitor....bummer. However, the Man With No Name wannabe thinks Roland knows about the treasure and perhaps a medallion given to Roland by the traitor holds the key. A strange banker, also is thrown into the mix. All three want the gold and all three seem pretty macho.<br /><br />Overall, this is not a principally distinguished Western. Much of it is the plot, some of it is that George Hilton (a Uruguayan despite the American sounding name) isn't as interesting as Eastwood or some of the other premier Spaghetti Western stars but most of it is because the soundtrack exclusively sucks. So traditionally the music doesn't even come close to matching the acting and it seems almost randomly added. Plus, it just isn't very good stuff as well. This notoriously isn't the work of Ennio Morricone--music master of the Spaghetti genre.<br /><br />Holistic, just a time passer--and not a particularly good one to boot.",0
"Admittedly, the lowest in the Spaghetti Westerns I've been watching lately: predominantly a low-brow rip-off of Leone's THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY (1966) with three disparate characters outwitting one another (and occasionally forming shaky alliances) in their search for hidden gold. Leonard Maltin rated it a BOMBARDMENT; while it's benign enough, it's also abundantly regular and, mortally, the three main roles are stereotypes, that is to say, uninteresting: Eddie Byrnes is a bank employee with ideas regarding his consignment being transported by train; Gilbert Roland is the ""mythical"" but ageing Mexican bandit (his frequent lapses into Spanish when excited are quite corny!) who, apparently, is still irresistible to women; George Hilton as an enigmatic bounty hunter tries too hard to emulate Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name figure. Director Castellari - whom I saw at the Italian B-movie retrospective held during the 2004 Venice Film Festival, where he came off as the most pompous of the cult movie directors present! - shows little vera sentiment for the Western (on the strength of two above-average Franco Nero efforts in the genre, I ordered his collaboration with Castellari KEOMA 1976...I'm keeping my fingers crossed now!) and the film's tongue-in-cheek approach is alike sorrowful.",0
"This is a classic example of what happens when a sit com is on TV for far far too long. Everything gets tired and the jokes start getting repeated over and over again. OK, from the start, the first couple of series were quite good. You had an Entertainment Manager (Simon Cadel) being pursued by his deputy played by Ruth Madoc, a cleaning lady wanting to become a yellow coat, an alcoholic child-hating Punch and Judy man, a bent Jockey, and a stand up comedian. As said earlier, it started well but went on way too long. Once Simon Cadel left it went downhill fast, you were getting dire story lines, and a new entertainments manager who Ruth Madoc (again) threw herself at. When a comedy is all filmed in one place there is a limit to the number of jokes that can be cracked. Unhappily this went on so long every joke was cracked 3 or 4 times over. If this comedy had been stopped after 2 series it would have gone down as an all time classic. As it is, it will be largely reminds for the frightful last few series.",0
"Even before this film it is clear to see that Ali G has become the exact character he set out to parody. I am not a fan of Sacha Baron Cohen's character anyway but was curious to see how a man of so little talent was able to convince universal studios to fund a near 1 and a half hour feature film out of a 3 minute joke. <br /><br />A paper-thin intrigue is just a torrent of dick and marihuana pleasantries and I must admit I did cringe when I saw such respected thespians as Charles Dance and Michael Gambon stoop so low for employment. Telling that I must admit (even if I am quite ashamed to) that I did raise a titter on more than one occasion, and however negative this film was it was never boring, and never once did I consider switched it off (mainly due to the wondrous Rhona Mitra). Saying that, only watch this film if you are a teenage lad aged between 14 to 17 and you find pecker pleasantries hilarious.",0
"I have absolutely no idea why I watched Ali G Indahouse except for the fact that Salon seemed to think a crime was committed by not nominating Sacha Baron Cohen for a Emmy for his work on Da Ali G Show. It is a sure bet that I will never watch that show as there was absolutely nothing comical about the movie. Comedy? Tortured was more like it. It was just about the silliest thing I every watched. I will admit that I was captivated by Rhona Mitra. I had not seen her in anything. She wasn't on The Practice during the time I was watching, so I guess I will have to check out Boston Legal one of these evenings to see how she does in something that may be worth watching.",0
"If I compare two films with Sacha Cohen, Borat and Ali G then Ali G is immeasurably best. I'ts no master piece, but it's a film at least. Borat is complete litter and I do not understand how it rated better then Ali G.<br /><br />I cannot put my finger on it, there something wrong with the Ali G script: half of the jokes are as if written by a 15 years old, not by an adult scriptwriter. And a number of jokes including Mr Cohen's lower body are quite tasteless. <br /><br />But the film actually comes together as a comedy and there are some valid jokes too that are funny: such as how Ali G becomes a member of government for doing something scandalous and stupid in the public (sadly true in today's western society: people get careers for doing stupid things in public), also Ali's advice about immigrant policy and some others. <br /><br />Ali G overall remains a empathy character, even though a kind of mentally underdeveloped for his age. But it's OK to watch,it's quite funny.<br /><br />But never ever watch Borat, it's heinous and makes every intelligent movielover sick.",0
"Bean, Kevin & Perry, BRITANNICA TV create that have made successful transitions onto the BIG screen. Now its Ali G's turn and I m afraid to say this is not one of them!<br /><br />Ali has always been indecent but hilarious with it. This film was extremley ill and not droll at all. Scenes involving bestiality, gay sex and paedophilia should not be portrayed for entertainment's sake.<br /><br />Ali G In Da House is trash and merited making very little moneys.<br /><br />1 out 10",0
"I had already heard of Ali G in Madonna's music video ""Music"". I always think he's funny. (In fact, he really is.) Just last year I always thought of buying a VCD of ""Ali G Indahouse"". That's why some months later, I bought it cheap and I started watching it.<br /><br />But the movies surprised me. My older brother and I were expecting it to be a great laugh-out comedy. It turns out that ""Indahouse"" is just a stupid piece of garbage. It was really really negative. It also contains explicit sexuality content and very crude humor. It also didn't made me laugh, even just a big smile. We definitely hate that movie. Oh by the way, I have plans to sell it.<br /><br />Ali G was really different in his movie compared to his TV shows-- in such a negative way. Maybe he wasn't really well-focused and enough serious to make this flick. Just because there's some sex scenes in it doesn't mean it's motherfucking comic (because sometimes, too much isn't that laughable anymore). For the first time ever, I was disenchanted at him. That really made me sad rather and delighted.<br /><br />I gave this movie 1 over 10. Actually, I really want to give it a 0 rating. It's one of the gravest cinematography I've seen in my entire life. I wouldn't recommend to anyone who wanna watch good comedies that aren't too explicit or horrible.",0
"I'm a Boorman fan, but this is arguably his fewest successful film. Comedy has never been his strong suit, and here his attempts at screwball farce are clumsily done. Still, it's almost worth seeing for Boorman's eye for talent: this is one of Uma Thurman's first starring roles, and as always she is enchanting to watch. (On a sad side note, Boorman wrote the script with his daughter, Telsche, who died a couple years ago.)",0
"Hard to imagine what they were thinking of when they made this movie (i.e., the writers, directors, producers, actors, editors, etc.). Christopher Plummer, veteran of 129 movies, frolics along between dozens of other protagonists with seemingly no more motivations than to collects a paycheck. I guess there is nothing wrong with that, but once they are paid that doesn't mean anyone has to watch it.<br /><br />It bugs me that there are actually good review for this movie here at imdb. Art? If you want to see art go to an art gallery, don't watch this movie. Comedy? Watch a re-run of the Flintstones, about the same plot with less time wasted.<br /><br />Dabney Coleman delivers his accustomed performance, for better or worst. And some of the young players may have gotten some good experience from doing this movie. But Plummer???? It was distracting to watch his performance, in fact I was actively mesmerised on him across the flick, knowing this was Plummer of Sound of Music renown! I see from his bio that he called Sound of Music ""sound of mucus"", so guess he didn't like it as much as the 100's of millions who liked him in it.<br /><br />I wonder if today he was asked, how do you rate Sound of Music compared to Where the Heart Is, what would he say.....?<br /><br />Probably something like ""Where the Money Is""....",0
"I had this movie given to me, and have to admit, I am happier that I did not wages cash for it.<br /><br />The back of the box makes it seem like some kind of sex triangle, with 2 women trying to seduce her. But the realism in this movie is far from that.<br /><br />In realities, the main subject is the victim of a vicious and sadistic rape by the two other characters. There was abundantly none in this that I uncovered interesting at all.<br /><br />Even film like Silence Of The Lambs and Wild Things (which the box attempted to comparisons this movie to) were enthralling, because of the unforeseen turns and wait.<br /><br />But Weary has nothing of this. It concentrated on the rapeists and the sick relationship with the boyfriend of one of them. And the persuit of a videotape that may prove the victims histories is true.<br /><br />While it does show that same sex rape is possible, it is not a movie worth watching.<br /><br />If at all possible, pass this movie up at all charges.",0
"Outside Sweden you are not expected have seen this movie. Delighted you. The cast includes several actors that are important part of modern the Swedish movie history. And still.. <br /><br />Seems like Peter Dalle only had a an idea lasting for about 20 minutes. Robert Gustafson is altogether maltreated in this movie, trying to copy a younger G√∂sta Ekman. Ekman, by the way, is the only actor fulfilling the expectations. <br /><br />Credit that can be given is for the photo, magnificent idea using black and white. Music is OK.<br /><br />But over-all it's a wastes of god actors and the time of the audience.",0
"If I could give this movie a negative rating I would. The humor is the cruellest I have ever seen in a film. Horrible things happen to good people and people who have already suffered horribly through no fault of their own. There are 2 plots, neither of which supports half of a film. Where is the ""depth"" others see in this movie? That no good deed goes unpunished? That only the heartless can succeed? The film does start well and the black and white is very moody and well done. The acting is very good and convincing witch makes the cruel humor even more horrifying. If you think that the 3 Stooges are too nice to each other, if watching the beheading of a kidnap victim with a Bowie knife is a real thigh slapper, if you thought ""Schindler's List"" was hilarious, then this movie is for you.",0
"As a South African, living in South Africa again after a 32 year stay in the UK, I am sorry to say that this cinema is a grands disillusionment. The three main difficulties I had with the movie was a) why Swank and Ejiofor - an American and a Nigerian - to play the leads. This country is bursting with talent and has no need of imports... b) Gillian Slovo has been trading off her Tussle credentials for years now. She's a very mediocre writer and even her novel doesn't stand up the flaccid direction of Mr Hooper... and c) Hilary Swank again, such a great actor, as proved in Million Dollar Baby (but that's Eastwood too), here dressed in the contemporary New York style whilst roaming freely around the poverty of the Karoo. Where was the consideration and sensitivity needed by the costumer and director? Yes, the film is lastly moving - how could it not be? - but the overall humour at the finding is one of phenomenal letdown. Heart's in the right place but must a rhythm bringer.",0
"Arthur Hunnicutt plays a very stereotypical role as a mountain man (probably the Ozarks) who goes hunting with his favorite coon dog. However, the dog appears to be drowning when Hunnicutt jumps in after him. It becomes obvious pretty soon that despite Hunnicutt and his dog roaming about after leaving the water that they both died in the water--as no one responds when he talks to them and sees and hears people talking about his and the dog's death. Yet, oddly, Hunnicutt is REALLY slow on the uptake and it takes him a while to understand they are talking about him! I think this was actually done as padding, as there really wasn't enough material to fill the half hour time slot.<br /><br />Later, in the ""surprise twist"", he comes upon Heaven--or at least his concept of the place. He's invited in, but since they won't allow dogs, he has other ideas! Overall, sensibly well acted but of dubious spiritual value! With no twists or irony, this episode is a bit dull--not ""Twilight Zone-y"" enough for my tastes.",0
"Where do I commencement? The tale was so naughty, it must have been handwritten in a high school film club! The acting was so wood I felt apologise for the protagonists! One actor even reminded me of what a deer must look like when staring into a car's headlights! Another protagonist has this unceasing look of being constipated! But it was the dialog that takes the cake! <br /><br />Our hero says to his captors - all holding submachine guns - if you lay a finger on a female pows you will be dead. Times later, the strongest guard, built like a truck, and the only women prisoner go at it. When our gallant leader, who has this very exasperating raspy gangster voice catches wind of this crimes, he serena walks up to the guard, while machine guns are trained on him, and in a split-second snaps this giant guy's neck like he was breaking a tooth pick! He then gets back in line while all the evildoers with their machine guns do absolutely nothing, but overwhelmingly yell at him!<br /><br />I could go on and on! This movie is camp gem; and if you have any sense of humor, it's guaranteed to make you laugh so hard your eyes will tear!",0
"Set in 1976 for no apparent reason other than to keep the set dressers busy, 'The Box' was directed by Richard Kelly ('Donnie Darko'), and stars Cameron Nunez and James Marsden as Norma and Arthur Lewis, a young couple who are supposedly fighting financially even though they both have successful careers--she as a high school teacher, he as an optical specialist at NASA's Langley, Virginia, Research Center. They have one child, Walter (Sam Oz Stone).<br /><br />One day the Lewises find a parcel on their doorstep, containing a black box with a big red button. There is a note from a 'Mr. Steward' indicating that he will return at 5:00 PM to explain about the box.<br /><br />The mysterious Arlington Steward, played by Frank Langella, shows up at the appointed time, nattily dressed in an elegant Savile Row suit. He is polite but businesslike, however his most seeming feature is his face, half of which appears to have been blown off and improperly attended to. Langella is the only thing worth staring in the cinema, however he is sadly upstaged by his own composition, which resembles that of Harvey 'Two Face' Dent (Aaron Eckhart) from Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight.' It's like the elephant in the room: one can try to ignore it, but it's more than a little distracting.<br /><br />Steward explains that he will return in 24 hours to collect the button. If, during that time, they decide to unlock and push the button, he will give them $1 million cash. The only catch--and it's a grand one--is that somewhere a stranger will die. It might be across town, it might be on another continent, however Steward assures them the victim will be someone unknown to them. As a show of good faith, he leaves them with a crisp $100 bill, theirs to keep whether they push the button or not.<br /><br />Arthur and Norma are skeptical, believing the whole thing to be a scam or an elaborate hoax, however it isn't long before they begin to wonder what would happen if they did push the button? Would they really get a million dollars? Would somebody really die? Weary of the speculation, Norm slaps the button. Nothing happens. However, their initial succour gives way to alarm when Steward shows up the next day with a briefcase full of cash. They decide to call the whole thing off, however Steward tells them it's too late. ""You've already pushed the button,"" he explains. As Steward's limo pulls away, Arthur notes the license number, which he later discovers is registered to the NSA (National Security Agency).<br /><br />At this point the film begins to veer deeply into unfollowable territory as the secondary characters start springing nosebleeds and flashing peace signs. Meanwhile, the town becomes invaded by pudgy, slack-jawed geeks in bad shirts who start following Arthur around like an advance scouting party for a race of zombie alien nerds. Arthur eventually becomes trapped by the menacing bookworms in the library (?), where Steward's spinsterish wife shows up--whom we haven't seen till now--and informs Arthur that in order to get out of the library he must step into one of three vertical columns of cheesy-looking digital water effects. 'What happens if I choose the wrong one?', Arthur asks, seeming far less baffled than he ought to be under the circumstances, and certainly far less baffled than the audience is by this time. 'Eternal damnation,' the spinster says ominously.<br /><br />Arthur steps into the middle column of digital liquid effects, and after a brief absence suddenly appears, still in his water cocoon, hovering over Norma's bed. When she wakes up and sees him, the water bubble bursts and Arthur tumbles onto the bed in a shower of water which, oddly enough, continues to drip from the overhead water pipes just out of camera range while a sodden Marsden and Diaz flop around on the bed.<br /><br />It's confusing, I know.<br /><br />We eventually learn that Steward was once the public relations officer for the NSA, until he was struck by a lightning bolt that destroyed part of his face. He was pronounced dead, but later came back to life, having been transformed into a sort of superman who now serves 'the ones who make the lightning,' and whose powers have enabled him to take over the CIA, the NSA, and NASA all by himself.<br /><br />And what is the point of all this nattering rubbish? Apparently, Steward's mission is to subject humans to a kind of biblical character test (e.g., the 'Binding of Isaac'), to determine whether humanity is worth saving. If enough people pass the button test by refusing to push it, Steward's god-like overlords will spare the race. Unfortunately, those people who do push the button, such as Norma and Arthur, must be punished for their moral spinelessness, to which end they are subjected to a series of dreary 'Lady or the Tiger' ordeals that play out like one of those 'Saw movies,' except without the entertaining gore or the benefit of a coherent plot.<br /><br />'The Box' represents the sort of pointless mental masturbation that freshman philosophy students like to blather on about after a few beers. Richard Kelly's tedious exercise in existentialist pettifoggery eventually collapses under the weight of its own incomprehensibility; the tortured melange of insupportable ideas eventually congeals, as with the mixing together of too many colors, into a meandering gray goo of a film as insipid as one of those narcotizing in-flight movies the plot of which suffers no more or less from having been interrupted by a leisurely nap.<br /><br />There is a point in 'The Box' where Arthur, who is a technically-minded guy, becomes curious about how the button works. Opening up the unit, he is disappointed to find nothing inside.<br /><br />Having seen The Box, I know exactly how he feels.",0
"In 1976 a mother named Norma Lewis (Cameron Diaz) lives with her son Walter and her husband Arthur (James Marsden). One night a box is placed on the doorstep of their home and the following morning they cut open the box to reveal a button device that must be opened with a key. By the late afternoon, a man with terrible scarring on his face comes to their door and presents Norma with an offer. This man is Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) and he announces that if they push the button someone in the world that the family does not know will die and they will receive a million dollars in cash. If they don't press it, nothing will happen and the offer will move on to someone else. Norma and Arthur are not allowed to tell anyone including their son about this deal. The incentive for the family to push the button is heightened by their financial difficulties. Arthur, who is currently working for NASA, fails to be accepted into a new job he applies for and Norma, who is a teacher, learns that her faculty funding is being cut.<br /><br />One's enjoyment for this inquisitive sci-fi thriller, based on the short story ""Button Button"" by Richard Matheson, will be determined by how far they are willing to take this ludicrous premise. The opening of the film is particularly challenging in grounding itself in a sense of realism with the household. Richard Kelly's previous film Donnie Darko cleverly used the condition of schizophrenia to justify its excursion into paranormal activity and parallel universes. Without the dream-like state of that far superior film, The Box and the very thought of a device that can kill anyone in the world, is entirely implausible. That Norma would also accept someone into her house that has almost the same scarring as Two-Face from The Dark Knight and believe this offer, seems equally contrived.<br /><br />If this sounds unlikely so far, what follows is even more nutty, involving a conspiracy about someone who was struck by lightning, the possibility of alien life or some other Godly being influencing these situations. Scenes involving gateways opening up in public libraries, random nose bleeds and mindless drones stalking the Lewis family, become hardly unintentionally hilarious in their absurdity. To a point, the film could be called intriguing purely to see where it is going. Kelly is occasionally clever in his ability to hold our attention through many of the films contrivances. In one scene Norma is teaching a class and then is asked by a strange boy about her foot. He taunts her about it as she is missing four of her toes. Later, at a rehearsal dinner for a wedding that Norma and Arthur are attending, this same student appears as a waiter and seems to be stalking them. Yet the eventual justification for these all of these oddities is wrapped up in a highly contrived sci-fi revelation that many will find implausible and difficult to swallow.<br /><br />What is most disappointing about the film is that once the button is pressed surprisingly early on, many of the moral implications that were initially promised are diminished for much of pictures duration. The ending, which won't be spoilt here, resurfaces these moral questions again in the hope of echoing that of a Greek tragedy. While the resemblances can be seen, by this point, given the unlikelihood of so much of the film and the uneven performances, there is little reason to care. Cameron Diaz's Southern accent might be unnecessary but it is surprisingly Langella who is the most disappointing in the film, with a very unsubtly written role, as the mysterious scarred man, who seems to be hiding a military base that would make Dr. Evil proud. It really is just a shadow of his towering performance in Frost/Nixon. There is not a lot for many of the other actors in the film to do; in particular both Norma and Arthur could not be regarded as characters but mouthpieces for Kelly's pastiche of ideas. Underdeveloped and brief conversations, such as where Norma sympathises with Arlington over their deformities and also when Norma and Arthur question whether they really know each other in case the button kills either of them, highlights this.<br /><br />Since 2001, Richard Kelly has failed to make a film that has lived up to the quality and the imagination of Donnie Darko. Though this film might be intriguing for a little while, it is too absurd and implausible to be fully enjoyed and it would certainly not warrant multiple viewings given the film's rather illogical revelations. Science fiction fans might be able to appreciate it somewhat more and draw their own conclusions, but what Kelly is really trying to say beneath the surface remains cryptic. The Box is one film this year that should have been shelved.",0
"I know that so many exams on IMDb are extreme, with reviewers either praising a film to the hilt or inarticulately tearing it to pieces. I find neither of these sort of inspects fruitful, and so I do not give this film the horrendous exams I am about to, lightly. The film is art-house science-fiction of the hardest sort attired up as a Hollywood blockbuster. The trailers draw you in by showing you what appears to be a cohesive plot, but is actually just a smallest part of a intentionally baffling series of phenomena which are never properly settled. I like films which challenge the viewer and I do not need to be spoon-fed a plot, and so my complaint against this film is not that it is too highbrow. No - the film is just frightful. As the credits roll you will feel genuine anger at having wasted your time on Cameron Diaz's wooden acting and a faltering plot-line. Stave.",0
"Be warns, the next time you see ""Richard Kayleigh"" involved in any production, run away. Fast.<br /><br />Kelly demonstrated to the world after his last films, ""Southland Tales"", that he is one pretentious superintendent. It was lenient and convoluted. In ""The Box"", not very has changed.<br /><br />I can pictured what his pitch to Warner Bros must have been, and I bet the executives at the studio eat it right up: a full-feature cinema based on one of Richie ""Sundown Zone"" Matheson's old short storytelling.<br /><br />Grands wrong! Do not read any further if you wish this cinematography ENTIRELY spoiled for you: <br /><br />Norm (Cameron Diaz) pushes the button. <br /><br />Turns out that Arlington Stewart (Frank Langella) has an Outsiders using his body as a vessel to conduct ""experiments"" in which the fate of mankind rests. His face is scarred because he was struck by Alien lightening, which killed him, but then brought him back to life to do all of this red button testing. Obviously since Norma pushes the button, knowing full well that someone may die, she must suffer the consequences for failing to consider someone else's life instead of her own. In the end she and her husband (James Marsden) choose to kill Norma instead of having their son grow up deaf and blind.<br /><br />Kelly dances throughout his film's ""message"", seeking to make the viewers figure out what the moral of the story is. Naturally, any person with a brain is saying at the beginning, ""What if I was the person who dies?"". Richie Killy doesn't yet leaving his character's have this usual, HUMANITY conversation. In facto, they avert it all together. They emerge to both be educated, working at a prestigious school and also for NASA, so why wouldn't they both have a best ability to LOOK OUTSIDE OF THE BOX???<br /><br />If he had the main trait actually have this conversation, the total film could have finalized right there! However, we have to watch weddings going on forever, NASA and the NSA be complacent to Arlington Steward taking over these government programs, teleportation to show Marsden life beyond our world so it will be ""easier"" to kill his wife, and drone's controlled by Steward which can be anywhere and nowhere, at any time.<br /><br />The most painful part of this movie is the pacing. Nothing really happens. Its a muddled mish-mash of ideas that are laughable.<br /><br />It is insufferable how this film is being marketed. The commercials make it look like ""Saw"" and even use the music from those films to sell it. In reality what you get is a slow, dull, laughable (yes, half the theater was laughing at the acting and visual effects), and messy film which is neither imaginative, interesting, nor cohesive. At one point, Cameron Diaz and her son are abducted and then suddenly, she is back in the NSA's big black car with her husband on the way home. Where did she go? Why did they take her? Do we really care? Not anymore you won't.<br /><br />By the end you really won't care what happens to any of the characters. You will be rooting for all of them to die so the film will just end. Go see anything else that's playing. Don't waste your time, or money.",0
"Ha ha. - oh no - what to say about this film? Yes - green eggs and ham makes more sense than this movie. Where does one start? A lot of the good stuff has already been said - so I won't divulge into the same territory. I believe you already have the movie abstract - so I won't paraphrase the movie.<br /><br />First - let's start the with good.<br /><br />1). If you like mental thrillers that make you think (as I do) the first 29 minutes of this film will be for you - this is one of those films that illustrates the question that you always talked about on long car drives when you were kids like (what if you had to chose one family member live, another to die, or, what if you had to die by drowning or fire) This movie is a wondrous concepts - bottom line.<br /><br />2) The cupboard group did a fine job with bringing us back to the 70's. Realistically though, how difficult is that to accomplish? .....Verywell, that's about all for the good. Let's chatter about the wicked.<br /><br />1). This movie thinks like a 2 hour ""Sundown Areas"" episode. This could easily be 90 minutes. That might have made the movie tolerable.<br /><br />2). Do you remember in the movie ""From Dusk til Dawn?"". The movie started out interesting, then halfway through the movies it just picked a humiliate turn? Yep - same stuff here. I would venture to say that the authors begun with a concepts, then had no idea what to do with it. I've gotten closer thought provocation out of Transformers 2.<br /><br />3). Yes - we get the dilemma in the film. We understand the philosophical undertones and Utilitarian approach - but the tales soared about way too much, didn't elaborate on the current tales arc, and took a(forgive me)completely insulting orientation.<br /><br />4). The ended didn't make sense. Not at all. No.<br /><br />This films could make a great term paper in college philosophy 101. If you're board out of your mind, in bed ill, or have ever enjoyed being hit in the face with a pie, and can view this free on-line - by all means, go for it.<br /><br />If you need to pay anything to view this movie, don't waste your time - you're better off watching old Howie Mandel stand-up on You Tube.

"THE BOX (2009) * Cameron Diaz, James Marsden, Frank Langella, James Rebhorn, Holmes Osborne, Sam Oz Stone, Celia Weston. Honestly disappointing coping of genre legend Richard Matheson's sci-fi chiller ""Button, Button"" by on the wane wunderkind filmmaker Richard Kelly who genuinely stretches a petit, well-crafted slice into a grab-bag 'WTF'-a-thon! Mysterious (and outrageously maimed!) man, Langella, posits a million dollar offer to 'struggling' couple Diaz and Marsden (both surprisingly vanilla bland to the hilt!): a box with a red-button, that when pushed, will kill some stranger in the world (!) Sure ropes are attached but does that really matter here? What does is why in the name of God does Kelly trowel on so much oddness (i.e. nose-bleeds; watery transport systems ¬ñ that's right ¬ñ Watery.Transport.Systems) when the tensile should be strung as tautly as possible (oh the possibilities). If this sounds like a bad TWILIGHT ZONE episode you are half right (the '80s TV re-boot actually did a decent small-screen adaptation; in fact rent that instead!) One of the year's hardest films.",0
"i thought id check this film out as I'm currently making a film about a mysterious box, therefore it would be great to see how this film took and developed the idea of a mysterious and unexpected box.<br /><br />before going to the cinema i had a high expectation of this film. with actresses, like Cameron diaz you would expect the acting especially hers to be great. the acting was a sort of let down for the film, the characters accents changed throughout the film it made it fabulous.<br /><br />the whole idea of a weird box that can make your dreams come true but destroy others is such a wondrous story but i feel the director leave it down, this film had potential it could of been a lot lot better than it was.<br /><br />this film had no middle to it. it was too confusing and needed a steady storyline. nobody wants to go into the cinema and come out thinking what have i just watched 'i didn't get it at all,' sometimes it can be exciting and make people want to watch it again, but this film made people want to never ever want to hear of the film again. throughout watching i noticed that half the audience had left before the ending. i feel every single person had been let down watching this film because of the high expectations and how slow parts of the film was.<br /><br />lets put the bad points to one side... i did like however the scene where the son is in the bathroom at the end. it was unexpected, it reminded me of a horror movie and the way it was put together made me imagine it and how devastating and scary it would of been to be in that position. the lighting and the effects made it look excellent, this scene looked slightly more 1990's than the 1970's that this film is supposed to be.<br /><br />this film was confusing because it had so many different bits to it. parts that you would expect to be sumned up at the end where everything comes clear but it didn't, it totally went against an audiences expectations, even though leaving the film on a cliff hanger, not giving the audience a reason why things happen could work and do really well, but this one didn't, it was a creative, different exceptional film i thought, it had potential could of been better, disappointed didn't enjoy it, wouldn't buy it on DVD to be honest.",0
"Couple having financial trouble gets a box delivered to their door. If they push the button they get a million dollars but someone they don't know will die. Do they push the button? <br /><br />This is an odd film based on a Richard Matheson short story has a few chills but especially is a chaotic affair. The troubles is that there is so much going on it feels as though writer director Richard Kelly didn't know what sort of movie he was making. Is this a straight out horror film with uncanny overtones? At times it seems like it with talk of moral choices, damnation and the afterlife. Is it a science fiction film? Possibly, there are lots of questions about that Mars project. And what are the strange looks that people seem to have as if in some grand conspiracy? Is this Invasion of the Body Snatchers or a malicious take over film? Don't know, maybe. And that's the problem there are lots of questions, most of them intriguing, but there are too many. Little seems to have been explained and when we get to the end of the film things seem more to stop then to conclude (even in an open ended way). I'm all for making a film rich with themes and points but writer Kelly fills his script with simply too many that director Kelly can't handle, or does so in such away that each theme or plot thread gets its ten minutes of screen time and for those minutes it hold court before its cast off the next bit. It made me crazy. (I won't get into the two leads, Cameron Diaz and James Marsden, who aren't very good or more likely don't know what to make of the material which is so ever shifting ) <br /><br />It's a heady blend that doesn't collaboration (there are ultimately too many holes). I got to the end and suddenly realized I had no idea what I just saw. I really didn't like it, but its more in a this isn't good because it just misses sort of a way rather. I'd take a pass or wait for cable where its not going to cost you anything",0
"This is my first review on IMDb.com and probably first ever written review of a film I've done of my own accord - not for some class assignment. I think that fact alone says something about this movie... not a buena thing! I am no seasoned journalist or critic (though I have seen my fair share of movies), but I found this unique film so extraordinarily painful to watch, it was essential for my own peace of mind to vent about the experience. Where better to do it than IMDb? As I forced myself to sit through the movie, physically writhing from the disability to connect-the-dots, I was sure there would be some ""light at the end of the tunnel"" - a revelation to explain what in samhe.-.ll was going on. The movie completed and I was as enlightened as dog****. After several rewinds to review certain scenes I still could finalise anything judicious. I found myself wanting to yell ""Does this make sense to anybody?"" I would recommend to not waste your time, but then again if I were you I'd probably want to experience it myself. If that's the case, bring a crossword puzzle or something so you don't get bored.",0
"The Box is a film with great potential, but the manufacturers altogether misused that potential. The film seemed to take for ever, because of the boring family dinners and scenes about school and job-dialogs between the action. Those scenes could and must be expunged in my opinion to keep up the tensity and thrill. The philosophy of human free will has potential and seems to referring to the philosophy of Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679), but we find ourselves regretfully struck with magic and nosebleeds, were even Harry Potter would flunked his class with!<br /><br />Probably the best part was that moment when Norma Lewis (Cameron Munoz)has been shot to death, by her loving and caring husband as an act of human free will. I wonder how Hobbes would react if he could...",0
"This is a flic that you can securely avert. boyish intrigue and poor acting from Cameron (she really shouldn't take on these severe roles - they don't suit her)Besides she seems most unglamorous, Lets face it, shes' great in Charlies Angels and She was splendid in There's Something about Marie... The Pope wouldn't be a good President of the USA and vice versa, my point being that there are some actors/actresses who are suited to a particular type of character and Cameron is most unsuited for this serious homemaker kind - there are a dozen other actress' would have done a far better job. The movie itself is quite phenomenal and juvenile in its intrigue (did I spell Juvinile right??) I noticed a comments from another reviewer who has given The Box a 10 rating, who was derisive in his comments on other reviewers who gave the movie a 1 or 2 rating and couldn't spell. I mean whats spelling got to do with a movie review? Does he mean that personas who spell perfectly could appreciate this movie more that the ones who couldn't? C'mon 'professor.",0
"Oddly, I have very little to say about ""The Box"" so this will be pretty brief. I have never read the Richard Matheson novella ""Button, Button"" from which the film is based, but considering what I saw in this ""adaptation"", there couldn't have been much semblance to such a legendary author's work. ""The Box"" is about a family who discover a strange contraption on their doorstep that has a button on it. Frank Langella shows up and explains how they will be given one million dollars if they push the button - the only 'catch' is that it will automatically kill someone, somewhere... ??SPOILER?? They push it ??END OF SPOILERS?? That whole concept was interesting on its own, but somehow they managed to extend the movie into some convoluted Stargate knock-off that pads it out until a pretty dignified ending with a pretty profound message. While I'm trying to be as 'fair' as possible, I still must say that this was not my cup of tea and it drilled me powerfully. I reckon its from the same director as ""Donnie Darko"" which I remember liking when I saw it years ago. ""The Box"" would've cooperating well as a short film, but since it was so lifelessly tailored this way, I can't come close to recommending it...",0
"Maybe if you smoked enough weed this would seem funny or would make you nostalgic for how completely unhinged people allowed themselves to be in the early 70's. There's an odd innocence to this movie and the sexuality is a lot more tricky and playful than the steely pros who do it for the cameras now.<br /><br />The real curio here - and really the only reason to watch this movie - is the appearance of Kristine Debell as Alice. She was a Ford model and it shows. She's got classic, WASP-ish good looks - like a really cute Ivy League sorority girl. So what the hell is she doing in this inexpensive, cheesy skin movie? From my vantage point she does not appear to be at all on drugs in this movie (which might explain it) and she actually seems incredibly committed to the part. When she sings her first song she really does act like she thinks she's flippin' Julie Andrews or something. I just get the feeling that this girl truly believed this was gonna be her big break or something, instead of the near career killer that it was. Anyway, she is damn charmer and you kind of can't believe she would even get naked on screen, much less do a masturbation scene, a couple of oral sex scenes (with men and women) and then do the real deal as a climax to the film (snark). It is also definitely not a body double at all. That is our little Kristine taking one for the team, or for the greater glory of showbiz or something. It's pretty magnificent to watch and it is definitely boosting (ahem) but in a way I kinda wish she hadn't done it. That was a very pretty, talented young girl getting some really bad advice.<br /><br />Anyway, my guess is that Kristine Debell, wherever she is, has long, long since wished this movie would go away. She was very cute and appealing in ""Meatballs."" Almost impossible to believe this is the same girl - but it is.",0
"Stay away from this movie. Far away. Phil Fondacaro stars as the demented ringleader of a Freakshow. Every performance is apartment and unfeeling, except Fondacaro's. The intrigue is a easy one, and follows almost every horror movie cliche possible. A group of high-school kids go to a carnival, see a side-show, and get in over their heads.<br /><br />Fans of Fred Olen Ray should be warned, this is not like any of his other films. This one is missing in all departments (humor, sex, horror, etc.) other F.O. Ray cinematography excell in.<br /><br />The version I saw also contained a Making-Of documentry, in which the director makes comments like ""We had a limited budget"" and ""with our limited timeline"" which speaks volumes about how much Charles Band cared about this film. Go rent ""Droid Runner"" (Fred Olen Ray) or ""The Dead Hate the Living"" (Full Moon) instead. Full Moon should be ashamed of themselves (and that's saying a lot after seeing ""Killer Eye"")<br /><br />Grade: D-",0
"This was not a very buena films, the acting pretty much stunk and the repercussions were inclement most of the time. But there were some funny moments but most of those were not meant to be funny. The most hilarious part of the movie to me was the part were a little kid in wheelchairs falls out (thats not the funny part What kind of person do you think I am)anyhoo the kid falls out and starts screaming for his big brother, well the brother comes running and the way the kid runs is so fun he's all stumbling and truthfully over acting I had to rewind it several times so I could chuckles some more. so if your looking for something to rent but just can't seem to find anything check this one out and watch for the running portion.",0

"Wondrous production and a good comedic performance by George Clooney can't save curiously detached, occasionally clumsy quasi-comedy from Joel and Ethan Coen. Depression-era road tale hearkens back to yesterday with three escaped chain-gang prisoners seeking a hidden fortune, and inadvertently becoming country music stars in the process! The film meanders along but never builds any momentum. It does get a big boost from Clooney's charismatic, Gableesque mugging, and also from the art direction and T-Bone Burnett's lively music. Otherwise, the screenplay (by the Coens) is seriously lacking in humor and interest, supporting cameos by John Goodman and Holly Hunter fail to add any hoist, and the second-half of the movie sliding precariously into self-indulgence. ** from ****",0
"Formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich Chilenian who stands to inherit a fortune and gets mixed up in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer (Vargas). It looks very much like a TV movie, not really exciting. The only reason I bothered to see it was because Valentina Vargas was in it. No real stuns here, though it is nice to see Vargas. Great searching Chilenian landscape on exhibition but Malcolm McDowell's part is very small and doesn't add much to the movie. Michael Ironside plays as usual a bad guy but this is not one of his most unforgettable parts. The chase scenes are standard fare.",0
"This movie is really AMISS, there is nothing tempting or worth of comment in it except for the beautiful setups: Chilean landscape.

Michael Ironside is the only one who saves the money in the film.",0

"Since Paul Kersey was running short of actual relatives to avenge, the third installment in the ""Death Wish"" saga revolves on him returning to New York to visit an old war buddy. He arrives only to find out that Brooklyn entirely changed into a pauperized gangland and that youthful thugs killed his friend and continuously terrorize all the other tenants of a ramshackle apartment building. Kersey strikes a deal with the local police commissioner, conquers the heart of his blond attorney, blows away numerous punks with an impressive Wildey Magnum gun and gradually trains & inspires the petrified New Yorkers to stand up for themselves. Alright, there's no more point in advocating the ""Death Desire"" serial after seeing part three. The 1974 original was a masterpiece that revolved on the social drama as much as it did on the retribution and, even though it was pure exploitation, part two still had quite a few redeeming qualities and at least the events were a logically linked to those occurring in the first. Number three often feels like a totally separate franchises. Apparently, Kersey isn't an architect anymore, he's ten times more societal and talkative than he used to be and suddenly nobody, not even the police, is against vigilante actions anymore? All these changes and several other aspects make it more than obvious that Michael Winner and Charles Bronson reduce their ""Death Wish"" success to being a purely brainless and exploitative actions series, with a death toll that gigantically increases with each episode, armory that becoming more and more explosive and criminals that obtain nastier, sleazier, meaner and a lot harder to kill. However, the gentlemen didn't seem to achieve that the non-stop spitfire of violence genuinely generates an opus impacts, notably this greatly monotonous and very more monotonous than the previous two. I once read a brilliant review that referred to ""Death Wish 3"" as the pure definitions of cinematic masturbate. This descriptions couldn't be more spot-on, as the hyphen tiredly shift itself from one despicable enforcement sequences to the imminent. Principally the definitive twentieth minutes are a finished ""orgy"" of ceasefire, bombings and executions realized through improvised handmade measures. Yi-Haaa! This entrance in the series has quite an interesting favourable cast, including Martin Balsam (""Psycho"", ""12 Angry Men"") as the fatigue neighbor who keeps machine guns in his closet, Ed Lauter (""Family Plot"", ""The Longest Yard"") as the slightly unorthodox copper and even Alex Winter (from ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure!) in his debut role as one of the thugs.",0
"The 3rd in the series finds Paul Kersey (Bronson) turning vigilante to get revenge on the thugs that murdered his old buddy. I don't know why this movie shoved me into it, but somehow it did. I found myself rooting for Bronson to wipe the floor with those punks. Every time he blew one of them away I felt good. This movie does not take itself seriously, but what if it did? There is a good build-up to the firework finale in which Bronson goes on a rampage. But as far as acting and plot go, it just doesn't measurements up. If I lived in that neighborhood, I would get out as fast as I could, but it seems like the people are asking for trouble. I know there is that mentality that we need to save our streets, but there is a limit here folks. I had to give it a 4. Sure there are good ""blow 'em away"" scenes but that's about it. At that time, Bronson was 64. I'm sure if those thugs really wanted to they could have their way with Bronson. Bronson takes the place of a Schwarzanegger or Stallone in this movie. This movie gives you a sense of rejoice. The common man can save the neighborhood, save the day. To sum it up, this is far from being the original Death Wish, but it is rather good if you are just looking for an hour and a half of shoot 'em up.",0
"OK, I just flipped channels and caught DW3. I watched it knowing it would be trash..BUT..as a person who has seen tons of films, this one stands up there as one of the most simply naughty film I have ever seen...I'm not kidding. It is so rotten you have to watch it, like a bad misadventure you can't turn away from. Sometimes these kinds of films work, IE, Troma film...but watching Martin Balsam and Karel Bronson slum it up like this is painful....What's even funnier is I pulled up IMDb to see what other people said and it actually scores a 4.1/10??? I can't believe it made it past 1.5! Equally as fun is this is not even the heyday of this series...someplace this refuse warranted part 4 and 5? And to top it all off, some dude's comments on here cite this as the best of the series and his favorite film of all time??? Statements like that scare me about this world!",0
"""Death Wish 3"" is the movie equivalent of a shooting gallery. All the features (apart from Bronson's Paul Kersey, of course) exist alone to be killed, either as ""provocation"" (the good guys) or as ""vengeance"" (the villains). The director exclusively pours on the reckless violence (people even get burned alive and molten up), turning this into an urban version of ""Commando"" (and Charlie, like Arnold, rarely bothers to protect himself from the enemy gunfire). Fans of this short of thing (and, visibly, there are many) will enjoys it, others....beware. (*1/2)",0
"This movie lacking credence for two motif. One, no mayor of a major city, and New York is certainly as major as it gets. Would allow a borough in his city to degenerate into such a violent place to live; especially for voters who could have much to say about his or her future job security. All of the victims in the movie were mostly elderly, Jewish or defenseless. At 62-years of age, I have never seen a movie that depicted such utter lack of respect for authority as this movie did. Even ""Escape from New York,"" which was imaginary, up front, i.e. they told you that this was science fiction, didn't resort to such deep-seated violence. In this movie, most of the elderly victims were victimized and yet had guns but were unwilling to use them. Also, in this movie and I have not seen the prior two, is more lawless than the ""Escape"" movie. Secondly, gangs as far as my investigate shows have never been as collaborative as this movie makes them out to be. On the one hand they catch a gang member from another gang working in their area and he's killed. Yet when the heroes start shooting at the local gang bangers, the next gang over is welcomed with open arms. Outside gang members are always viewed as outsiders and are stopped. We are supposed to believe that when automatic weapons are used against our gang, the other gangs want to be all into it. Why did the outside gangs come to help? I believe that more than one gang from outside came to help. What did they come for? Another question, why was the gang leader in jail and why do fellow jail inmates ask his permission to attack Bronson's personage? This was not a wondrous cinema and I could go on, but I won't.",0
This movie could very well have been a propaganda movie for the North americian falangist party - or some similar group... The strong man (Kersey) places himself above the law (but not outside the law) and liberates upstanding citizens by killing worthless trash. The only thing that made me think it wasn't made by the KKK was the fact that a jew starred as a good guy... Try watching it again while thinking of it as a propaganda movie for an extreme right wing group - and you'll see what I mean...<br /><br />It's a drama that Jimmy Page genuinely made music for this movie... :(,0
"I was frustrating with the third film in the ""Death Wish"" series and wouldn't recommend this unless you are really into Bronson. He is his usual self in this one, maybe a bit lighter hearted than in the others; the rest of the cast is good if your watching a movie of the week on T.V. - the whole film has the production value of a bad episode of the A-Team and I like the escapism fun of a show like the A-Team but not on the big screen, even if it is an action movie that doesn't claim to be anything to sophisticated. The film takes a while to get going and then when it finally does, it obtains out of controls to the point of ridiculousness. The plot is something out of an episode of ""Highway to Heaven"" and Bronson seems like a fish out of water with the majority senior citizen cast and the howitzer playing is so out of control you don't even get any satisfaction from Bronson's revenge against the bad guys. Skip this and go on to the 4th temperament which I tremendously recommend.",0
"I was pulled into this movie early on, much to my surprise, because I hadn't intended to watch it at all. Now I wish I hadn't. The suspense starts out well, with the hit-and-run resulting in death and the question of whether the guilty character will confess, or be found out, or (doable now, though a no-no in the old days of movie-making) get away with it. The plot's been done before--what plot hasn't--but the tensions inherent in it, with the additional complications and motivations arising out of the illicit love affair, make for an absorbing first half. Then the film abandons the hit-and-run to launch upon a misty show of two unrequited, all-suffering loved. The two tracks of plot--hit-and-run and unreasoning love--just don't have enough to do with each other, and that they involve the same characters doesn't bind them enough to justification the departure from the original story line. The screenwriter should have chosen one plot or the other. At the end of the film, in the midst of the movie's second funeral, I found myself thinking, ""Now, what does any of this have to do with that hit-and-run?"" The filmmakers may think the answer obvious, but I think the movie was plotted and executed flabbily.",0
"I'm a monumental breather of both Emily Watson (Breaking The Waves) and Tom Wilkinson (Normal) and was amused to see them upstaged by Rupert Everett (Dellamorte Dellamore) in this stunningly quite smaller movie that had all the component to be so very more. The too writ scenes in which he portrays a languid, infinitely entitled, unnecessary son of a rich Lord are spot-on and entertaining. But for a love triangular there was surprisingly small chemicals to speak of between anyone. The musical was annoyingly movie-of-the-week quality, and the voice-over dissenting and perfectly unnecessary. Clara the works of a first-time superintendent with a small budget who either lacked or didn't properly heed alright advisory. Too amiss.<br /><br />I can grateful how the people you kind of hating at the beginning are the ones you kind of like at the end, and vice-versa, so there is some sort of character arc, at least in terms of perceptions. For example, Watson's character, while refreshingly honest to her husband about her feelings for another man, begun to grate on me near the end, particularly when she declared to her husband that she simply had absolutely no control over her actions, and later when she simply declared that she would be moving back into their marital flat, with no asking of permission, no apologies offer. And I went from disliking Wilkinson's control freak / moral relativist character to sort of understanding him and not really wanting him to change (unlike his wife).<br /><br />This movie awkwardly morphed from a whodunit to a ""Love Story"" or ""Steel Magnolias"" illness drama without sufficiently informing me of the fact, so I was left distractedly guess what the next plot twist might be long after they had all been revealed (Was it the Lord driving the car? The Lord's dog?). The scene where the Gods tours Wilkinson and covers how brave Watson is, the bestest nurse any dying boyfriend could ever ask for, Florence Nightingale incarnate, etc. was OK until he begun over-the-top sobs like a baby. Good God! If you ask me she's just another flitty rich person with way too much time on her hands, and so she drives her tough works, well providing spouse crazy with unnecessary tragedy. His screwing around was just another manner to occupying her emptiness life; the dying boy thing was an added bonus for her as it somehow made her previous actions completely above reproach.<br /><br />Look, everyone would have been better off if Wilkinson had just left her for his secretary, who seemed to appreciate him for who he was. Instead he acted like an abused dog, his open craving for his wife's affection increasing with every kick she gives him. I'm not anti PC or anything, it just didn't ring true, even after taking into account all of the harsh realities of middle age we all tend to face. The ending for me was (and not the director's intention I am certain) depressing. The movie spent the last 80 minutes convincing me that these two people just don't belong together, so I found no joy in the promise of their relationship continuing. I'm not above wanting my emotions manipulated by a story, it just has to be somewhat plausible and not hackneyed. Is that asking too much?<br /><br />My score: 4/10",0
"First of all, I would like to say that I am a fan of all of the actors that appear in this film and at the time that I rental it, I want to like it.<br /><br />I think that the primary reason that I was so frustrating was that the outside box pledging me a suspense thriller. In my eyes, a suspense thriller for British movies is like something out of a Ruth Rendell novel, something that has a lot of somber twisting and turns and leaves the viewer with an ending that is unlikely to be forgotten anytime soon.<br /><br />This movie started out with the promising note of being such a film. We have our main character, that suspects a man that he does not like, of being involved in a hit and run that killed the husband of one of his servants.His notions prove to be right, but the idea that his wife might be involved, does not occur to him until that she confesses to him that she was a part of the crime.<br /><br />The elements of a good suspense thriller were in place, at this point, but from there, I felt that the film took a different direction and became almost some sort of a gentle soap opera about who wants to be with who and what the love of a real relationship is. The film might have been enjoyable to me, if the outside box had talked of a twisted lover's triangle and had not been labeled as suspense thriller.This seemed to be more of a soap opera story and the beginning setting seemed to be a mild distraction to the true content of the film. I felt like this film could have done a whole lot better than it did. I felt like it kept leading the viewer up to a big events that never materialized. So, I have to give it a lower assessments than I would have liked to and say that it fell short of my expectations.",0
"The basic genre is a thriller intercut with an uncomfortable menage-a-trois. Fellowes has tried to make a lot more out of this, using the lies of the title in order to bring about all manner of small twists, invariably designed to surprise the characters more than the audience.<br /><br />It's really rather chaotic though. Fellowes doesn't seem interested presenting the thriller elements in a fashion that will keep us seat-edged. Rather his focus is on the moral predicaments themselves.<br /><br />The dialogue is inconsistent, stagey here, vernacular there and with the nonstop surprise of realism undone by the occasional clich√©-landmine. Though there is no fussing over the locations so that the actors can get on with existing in their space the dreadful punctuation can't create a further dimension and often works against the emotional momentum of given set pieces. There's also a very prosaic, dare I said it British feel to the filming. I didn't want to seeing a document of two successful middle class people caught in an extraordinary situation, I wanted to see some sort of artful recounting of the story.<br /><br />Finally it is, in fact, the story which lets the rest down. Just as the elements of suspense are rather flat so the story is an asymmetric sum of subplots of different shapes and sizes, woven as a vehicle for character examination. Wilkinson and Watson support this meta-essay with good performances and John Warnaby's ebullient colleague Simon to Wilkinson is a welcome foil for much of the brow-furrowing.<br /><br />I'm disappointed; not that it's bad, but that it could have been much better. 3/10",0
"Writer & director Robert Downey, Sr., a pioneer of the subterranean film movement in the 1960s, satirized the New York Madison Avenue advertising world with his avant-garde humour ""Putney Swope."" Downey doesn't confine his ridicule to advertising, but tackles black militant culture, the dynamics in Hollywood's depiction of race, the elite white power structure, and character of corruption in any power struggle. As audacious and ambitious as ""Putney Swope"" strives to be, it qualifies as a frightful filmmaking, amateurishly effected on a shoe-string budgets with a no-name casting and humour that missing hilarity. Everything about this cinematography reeks with improvisation. ""Putney Swope"" sparked up controversy during its initial releases with its politically incorrect handling of race issues and consumer culture. Like most Marx Brothers movies, the plot is delgado, providing an apologies for Downey's anecdotal gags, most of which are dire.<br /><br />The chairman of a prestigious Madison Avenue ad agency dies during a board meeting. Before the body has been removed, the board holds a secret ballot vote to determine who will replace him. Each member understands that they are forbidden to vote for himself. Sheer accidents occurs when everyone votes for the token black member, Putney Swope (Arnold Lbj), since none thought anybody would cast a ballot for him. Swope pink slips all but one of the white executives, surrounds himself with black, pistol packing employees, and renames the firm ""Truth and Soul Advertising."" Swope decides to alter the face of American advertisement. He refuses to accept clients whose products are alcohol, tobacco, or war toys. Swope's clients stage an exodus after he becomes the CEO, and grandstanding attracts a new line-up of clients that show up at his office lugging bags of money and prepared to suffer abuse from Swope's militant officials. Swope feats his African-American staff, too, ruthlessly appropriating their thought after he fires them and conjures up a number of abusive advertisement campaigns, all of which are welcomed as a 'new wave' of marketing genius. Amazingly, Swope's conservatism illustrates successful but the agencies become the target of government operatives who argue Swope's advertising tactics constitute ""a threat to the national insurance."" The high point of this black & white, 85-minute comedy are the television commercials shot in color. Unfortunately, Downey doesn't know when to cut off these ads that consistently start out cleverly but wear out their welcome. The funniest part of ""Putney Swope"" involves our eponymous protagonist's dealings with U.S. President Mimeo in Washington D.C. (Pepi Hermine), a marihuana-toking midget with a Kissinger-like Teutonic adviser (Larry Wolf) spouting tasteless jokes while trying to convince Swope to come up with an advertising campaign for his new car, the Borman 6.",0
"Black and white satire of a Madison Avenue ad agency being taken over by blacks. They're headed by Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson) who is determined to change things. However he turns out to be even WORSE than his white predecessors. That's about as original as this gets.<br /><br />I'm sure this was considered daring and shocking in 1969 but it just seems silly today. The jokes are either unfunny (the president is a midget. HOW is this funny?), cruel or obvious and the film is full of unlikable characters. It's done in a very experimental way which makes it even harder to take...or understand. The movie just gets more surreal and surreal as it goes along. The ending comes out of nowhere. To make it worse, with the sole exception of Johnson, ALL the acting is negative. Antonio Fargas (a regular in these types of films) is especially annoying as the Arab. This gets three stars because the commercial parodies (done in bright color) ARE amusing and there's a rare good line here and there. I heard this was a cult classic but this is more interesting than good. Skip it...unless you're in experimental 1960s films.",0
"This is a poor apologies for a movie. A film negro done by Busbee Berkeley? Please! First, let's forget about the plot, a truly simple-minded version of a cynical tough guy turned into a saint by the love of a pretty blonde. Yechh. So what turns her from despising him to loving him? Along with a group of other guys, he helps keep a kid from drowning as they all swim in a water tower and try to survive as the water is siphoned off, stranding them. It isn't precisely heroics, but she's suddenly smitten. It's honestly painful to watch Claude Rains try to describe a hard-bitten, tough-talking, noir-type cop. A crooked scowl is his leading and rather unlucky acting tool, along with a growl voice. Most of his energy seems to go into trying to hide the intelligence that shines in all his other roles. How he ever got talked into taking this job I'll never understand. Enjoy it, if you can, for a few period details, the old cars and gas pumps, but don't hopes a decent movies experience. It squandered 1-1/12 hours of my life.",0
"The Monkees ""Head"" is one of those peculiar phenomenons I've noticed- that when something doesn't make sense, people will try to read things into it and give it great deep meanings, which its creator never intended. Such is the case here.<br /><br />The film is a stream-of-consciousness spectacle of The Monkees floating in and out of various sketches, blackouts, set pieces, etc. similar to the ones on their TV show. But while the TV show was played for laughs, this doesn't seem to be played for anything except a sort of deep, trippy, pseudo-intellectual state that this brand of psychedelia imposes. All in all, it's The Monkees doing the same schtick, but now it's ""consciousness-raising"" because the laugh track is removed. There is not a sewing of humor or meaning to the whole thing; it just drones on with colored lights.<br /><br />The music in ""Head"" should prove to anyone, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that the Monkees had not a scrap of songwriting ability. The tunes are mostly garbage; the only one that's even listenable is ""Porpoise Song"", which opens and closes the film. But the thing is, that was a Gerry Goffin-Carole King song, and, while it's above-average for the Monkees, it's below-average by Goffin and King standards. It's like hearing one of the old Peter And Gordon songs that Paul McCartney wrote for them: you might think it's a pretty good song, but then you find out who composed it, and you realize it's a throwaway. Mike Nesmith's song is maybe passable, the rest is meaningless. Davy Jones has, I guess, what the filmmakers imagined to be ""the big number"" in the picture, since it's the only song presented As Show Biz and not cut into a film montage or dream sequence, but it autumn apartment, too, just because the song isn't any buena.<br /><br />I have to admit I always liked the Monkees, so the movie is a reales disillusionment. Sure, they were cheesy, but they were so joyful about it.<br /><br />They knew they were cheesy and they were cool with it. But then they got ambitious. In ""Head"", they actually joke about being a manufactured pop product, but the truth is, they wanted something more. They wanted to be Great Musicians and taken seriously as artists. Maybe not like the Beatles, but something approaching that. ""Head"" proves that they failed on all counts. 1* out of 4",0
"This is possibly the hardest movie i've ever seen, it was terribly accomplished it didn't flux it was very tumultuous, because of that various people didn't fathom the film at all. I had to watch this movie different times before I got an idea about what was happening, ALLRIGHT its like this a kid stole someones car and while running from the police he total it, for some reason the cops let him off and he has to face his parents who sent him to live with his uncle out in the wilderness, there he meets a girl who loves to rock climb and he gets into the sport and has to beg his uncle to let him enter a contest for climbing, and yeah thats about it like i stated terrifying film.",0

"***POSSIBLE TROUBLEMAKERS BELOW*** <br /><br />What a lengthy and essentially uninteresting movies! Who were these characters? Why didn't I care about them? If I'm going to watch a cinema for two hours, I'd like to care about somebody or something. <br /><br />We know that Salvatore dreamed of the riches to be found in the new world. Afterlife that, though, we learnt little about most of his family's waits, fears, etc., as they embarked on an adventure into the unknown.<br /><br />And why was Lucie yet in this cinematography? She said little; we knew tiny about her or what she was doing (was she forced to service men in exchange for being allowed to board the ship?) or what her plans were after reaching New York. To those who might suggest that she was needed to underscore the point that a single woman, however cultured, could not get into this country alone, I say that that fact is not enough justification to give her so much screen time. That point could have been made in five minutes, with Lucy as a momentary trait.<br /><br />More questions: Why wasn't the twin brother at the boat to meet the family? We heard about the brother, and some closure on that point ought have been instrumental in giving the cinematography some cohesiveness. Also, how long was the journey from Italia to New York? Given the conditions on the boat, it makes a difference to the viewer if the voyage took five or 10 or 50 days. (Anyone said something about seeing land a ""week"" at one point, but I think that was when they were already en route.) I needs these genus of particulars to best appreciate what they were gonna through.<br /><br />The only scene I genuinely loved was when the boat, filled with passengers, left the dock. <br /><br />If you choose to leases this film, do so with distant in hand; you may want the Fast Forward button convenient.<br /><br />Finally, maggio I suggest that, with the right voice-over providing beneficial information about the moments and the circumstances for immigrants--particularly during the slow stretches of endless shots of the countryside, people walking, etc.--this movie might have made an interesting public TV documentaries.",0
"The most generic, surface-level biography you could hope for. Busey's impersonation of Holly is accurate -- but who wants to hear Gary Busey sing ""Maybe Baby""? Typically, the members of the Hollies are used for comic relief and melodrama (Smith and Stroud, respectively) instead of as people or even characters. When Holly uses a string section, the old jewish-looking guys who come in tell him he's using the same techniques as Mozart. It's just this kind of cheeky statement that makes film biographies like this (and ""Amadeus"", about the aforementioned Mozart) so dispensable. Some amusement can be derived from Holly's excellent styles and songs done in a B-variation.",0
"To remake ""Lost Horizon"", as a musical, the need for a Rodgers & Hammerstein or Lerner & Lowe type musical composition was needed. Burt Bacharach and Hal David were the wrong choice. Having said that, my favourite thing about ""Lost Horizon"", is its score. It's just that the score doesn't fit the piece. The cast, is made-up of mostly non-musical talents (Ullman, Finch and Hussey, were all dubbed, and still don't sound all that wondrous).<br /><br />Honestly, the novella, on which this, and the earlier non-musical film versions were based, is mediocre, at best. While the possibilities for a truly good, cinematic musical version exist, they are not realized here. The film succeeds at being a good, rainy-day vehicle, to pass the time. Otherwise, you are better off, buying the CD of its soundtrack. Only recommended as a curiosity piece, due to the film's terrible reputation. I've seen much better; but I've seen MUCH worse.",0
"..but unluckily no one thought about having Van killed in order to saves this doomed productivity. The only beneficial thing about him in the film is his nice singing voice...too bad the lyrics are mostly insipid and sappy. Why did I hating Van so much? Well, throughout the film he seemed like he was doing a third-rate Soupy Sales imitation--with lots of mugging, bad jokes and way too much energy spent trying to make everyone laugh. The worst of these times was when he was ""teaching"" the class--these kids laughed at EVERYTHING he did. Heck, Van could have read the phone book or showed them autopsy photos and they probably would have laughed! Now Van was not the only bad pouring decision in the film--he was just the most manifest. Of course, having John Gielgud (a lovely actor) play an Asian was nonsense as well as having Michael York gaming Peter Finch's brother!! The bottom line is that because of these insane casting elected, the film was doomed from the start....and the worst of them was the god-awful Bobby Van. Now in real life, he might have been a cute person and it's unfortunate that in real life he died so young, but with the material they gave him here I just wanted to rip out his tongue to get him to be quiet.<br /><br />Now I also cite the songs--egad, those shocking songs!! The original LOST HORIZON by Frank Capra was a subtle pleasure throughout--and not a single song and dance number in the film. Therefore why did they decide to add a bazillion lyrics that did nothing to help the film? They only served to make it seem like a gooey mess--like the original DOCTOR DOOLITTLE combined with LOST HORIZON. The end results is a sick sweet children's movie--not one that can be adored by anyone over 8.<br /><br />Nowadays if you can remove these hassles, you have the basis of a decent movie. Upon all, the intrigue is lovely and is still stealth beneath all the goo. Peter Finch is especially buena (though certainly not the equal of Ronald Colman in the original). But, considering that the original was a near-perfect classic, why disturb with this slimy confectionary. Who wanted to wade through the treacle?! <br /><br />By the camino, this film was included in ""The 50 Worst Films"" book by Harry Medved. While I, too, disliked the film, it wasn't bad enough to merit inclusion in the book. I think it was included mostly because it was such a huge box office failure and because it was released just a few years before the book appeared. An excellent book--just not one of the best selections to the ""hallowed hall"" of dreck.",0
"I can imagine what happened for this film to come into being: a bunch of studio guys are sitting around, drinking gin-and-tonic, maybe a joint, and one of them comes up with the idea that it would be great if they could find a film that would bridge the generation gap, which at that time was about as far apart as Archie Bunker and Mick Jagger. Something that both college-age rebels and their parents would find equally interesting-- for different reasons, perhaps, but still, a ticket is a ticket. What interested hippies? Asia, philosophy, pacifism, and wild sets and costumes. What interested their parents? Musicals, eye candy, a feel-good script, and nostalgia. Very well, then, ""Lost Horizon"", the old classic, as a musical, in color. Can't miss, right? It was a blasts. Lost Horizon, by James Hilton, is perhaps less than a classic, but not a bad novel. In broad terms, he sketches out a utopian society in Shangri-la, ""The Valley of the Blue Moon"", near Tibet, inhabited by peacefully contented villagers who serve an abbey of <i>very</i> long-lived monks. Intruding into paradise is a Gilligan's Island-like planeful of outsiders (a veteran of WWI, a missionary, etc.) each with their own spin on the situation -- what plot there is concerns the reaction of each of them to being presented with a choice to live in paradise, or try to return to the tumult of the Twentieth Century. Taken on its own terms, it's gentle, pop-lit fluff, presenting Hilton's own conservative British views in ""Oriental"" dress, as exotic and as familiar as a fortune cookie. As captive honored guests of the monks, the castaways are forbidden to leave the valley, but never pressed into work or prayer (not that the monks do too much of that themselves), treated royally, and given simple, yet luxurious accomodations --who'd want to escape? In this Middle American Heaven-on-Earth, the monks are both cultured and wise, the climate is warm, the food is plentiful and tasty, the villagers are picturesque nonentities and nothing ever changes. The nuns are chaste, but encouraged to look pretty, and even flirt a bit ( the reason given is one of the most hilariously inaccurate explanations of Tantric Sex I've ever read). Even their religion is nonthreatening: revealed as a best-of-both worlds blend of Christianity and Buddhism, there's little to offend any but the staunchest fundamentalist or the oddballs out there who actually knew something about Tibet (which in the early Thirties was a very small number).<br /><br />As a Capra film focussing on the adventure/character interplay angles it was enchanting; and perhaps Steven Spielburg could have made it fly, if he'd been around. As an early-Seventies Hollywood product, the adventure was over too quickly, and the updated roster of characters too bland, to make much of an impression. Deprived of the sketchy, suggestive qualities of classic B&W, the monastery resembles a de luxe beauty spa in white and pale blue, and while at least some of the monks' robes tried for historical accuracy, most of the rest of the inmates looked as if on their way to a morning massage and fango bath, with a couple of holes of golf in the afternoon. Maybe Stephan Sondheim could have restored some grit to the story, playing up the very real conflict inside each character's reaction; just five years afterwards, Brian Eno would have captured the tranquil atmosphere to a T; instead, Bert Bacherach and Hal David were given the job of writing the songs, which marry Muzak-like melodies with some of the clunkiest New Agey lyrics ever penned. Quite naturally for the time, every song calls for a dance number, which range from the merely forgettable to the completely boring, and so is the script, which has not one line worth quoting.<br /><br />Tie-ins with this movie were legion -- there were everything from cookbooks to posters planned to promote this film, and such was the hype that I actually went out and bought the sountrack album. Just about the only thing good I can say about it is that it made enough of an impression on me to write this review completely from memory nearly thirty years after -- the next month I read Aldous Huxley, bought a copy of the Bardo Thadol, and hence learned about real Tibetan culture. Moan.<br /><br />",0
"I watched ""Deadly Voyage"" because David Suchet was in it, after enjoying him in the ""Poirot"" series. And Joss Ackland is always worth watching, so I went into the film with an expectancy of it being a perhaps advantageous films. Alack, it was not to be.<br /><br />I won't bother critiquing the performances, the pacing, the films or any other structured aspect of the films; others here have already given their view on those ingredient. The only thing I want to treating is the film's message, since it proclaims in the enter that it's based upon a true story, and therein hangs the film's presumed importance.<br /><br />""Deadly Voyage"" primarily focus upon an impoverished black African man named Kingsley who wants to move to the US, because he believes that he can make money there. Nothing more, nothing less -- his motivation is utterly selfish. (Of course some people will prevaricate by saying that he was doing it for his family, but in fact he decided to have children on the income he could make in Ghana, so he really just created his own issues.) To that end, Kingsley decided to stow-away aboard a Russian freighter bound for New York. In the process of doing this, he confronting inhospitable conditions, racist crew members and other difficulty.<br /><br />But this is accurately where the kino leaves me unmoved. Why should the spectators be awaited to care about Kingsley? Simple because he has a goal? Goals aren't such a uncommon commodity that his should be privileged above say, the goal of the ship's captain or the woman he left at home with his newborn kid. Kingsley's aim is illegitimate in the eyes of the US Government. It is also illegal in that it steals from the Russian shipping company. If he makes it to the US, it would involve taking out of a system that he has not put into. And if he gets caught, the shipping company will be fined $45,000. I doubt very much that any of the stowaways care about what their chosen course of action is costing anyone else; they're plainly just out for their own gain. He could've spent the $1,000 he won in the lottery at the beginning of the film, for legal passage to the US, and applied for residency and a work permit. Instead, he takes the illegal (and dangerous) route.<br /><br />So since Kingsley's voyage is illegal, selfish and cannot be ethically justified, why should we care about him or his ordeal? Simply because he faces challenges? Why should his challenges be privileged above the challenge of the Russian shipping company getting to New York without stowaways? Because he's black and the shipping company is white? The reason seems to be because Danny Glover (the film's executive producer) and others involved want us to root for Kingsley, as if he's a hero on some sort of noble voyage. But once you accept that illegal immigration, theft and a fool's mission aren't noble at all, you can't really care about him.<br /><br />Before anyone plays the race card, I assure you that I would've felt the same no matter what ethnicity/nationality the involved parties were. Imagine if a British person decided to stow-away in a train headed for Bhutan, sneak across the border, and collect ""unwanted"" Buddhist antiquities, to bring back to Britain to sell. How much sympathy could the challenges he faced generate? Very little, I'd bet. So why should we feel different for Kingley? Because he's black? Because he's poor by American standards? The filmmakers are banking on us sharing their views that the ends justify the means, and that a shipping company being fined $45,000 is inconsequential compared to the remote possibility of an unskilled laborer earning slightly more in the US than he could've if he had just stayed in his own home country. I didn't buy it for a minute.",0
"Watching Showtime I got the impression that the producers got the idea to put Robert DeNiro and Eddie Murphy just for the sake of having a film that co-starred the two of them. Other than that I can't think of a reason to justify the film's existence. Not that it isn't amusing in spots, it certainly is, but the notions is so completely absurd that the grin are somewhat speechless.<br /><br />The thing that really got me was Eddie Murphy's character. I can't seem to wrap my mind around the concept of someone being a police officer as strictly a day job. When I was working person at New York State Crime Victims Board I had to deal with all kinds of cops and they ran the gamut between the really dedicated and some real slugs, but I can't think of one who thought that this was just something I do until I get my career going in an area far afield. I mean, can you really see Eddie Murphy or anyone else going through the rigors of the real Police Academy, not the screen version, just to get a day job?<br /><br />Anyway DeNiro is your basic hard working detective who's on the trail of a major gun dealer. He's undercover and Murphy is part of his backup. So what does the showboating Murphy do, he calls a reality based TV series like COPS to film the action. <br /><br />So DeNiro's bust gets blown sky high, but the producer of the show gets some good footage of Murphy and DeNiro and decides on a new reality based television series. So these unwilling partners get joined and try to continue working DeNiro's case with all the TV cameras around.<br /><br />Eddie Murphy's a funny guy, I loved him in Beverly Hills Cop and in the Doctor Doolittle movies, but he's done better things than Showtime and Robert DeNiro certainly has. <br /><br />I guess Murphy wanted a chance to work with DeNiro and DeNiro must have gotten one hefty paycheck to do this film.",0
"Two popular actors are paired in showtime like De Niro and Murphy playing a police and an actor. Although they share the most screen time together, they do not reach their expected performances such films like Analyse This, Meet the Parents, Dr Doolittle and Nutty Professor. The film starts interestingly but becomes a delgado, normal humour which is rather frustrating.It feels like especially De Niro doesn't enjoy being in Showtime. Thats a shame because he really shows his passions thats what I think. Unfortunately, if the idea had been used cleverly this could have been a more interesting piece of work and could be followed with a sequel like any other popular Hollywood movie. Well, I don't think there would be a sequel to this at least casting De Niro and Murpy again. ** out of *****",0
"The movie is not as hilarious as the director's preceding (and only other) movie, Shanghai Noon. Showtime did have its moments, but it did not comply me. Why it needed to be so foulmouthed, I don't know, but I lend Showtime **/****",0
"Bubbling just beneath the surface of Showtime is a good thoughts. Actually, it's more like two or three visions that regularly battling for screentime. This film doesn't just have its cake and eat it too; it has the whole bakery.<br /><br />Detective Mitch Preston (Robert De Niro) has a drug bust interrupted by the media and a brash, cop-slash-actor named Trey Sellars (Eddie Murphy). When Preston's partner is shot, he angrily shoots the camera out of the hands of a pestering newsman, and the tiff lands him in a new realism cop show produced by Hunts Renzi (Rene Russo). In the first of many errors and oddities in the movie, that injured partner is never heard from again or alluded to for the remainder of the film.<br /><br />De Niro's best gag is his speech to a classroom of small children to open the picture about how TV cops don't act like real cops. Funny thing is, as the movie evolves, his character and Murphy's begin to act more and more like the clich√©s they supposedly clash so strongly with. In a malin movie, De Niro's diatribe could have played as ironic comment; here, it only shows to point out how really lame the movie is. Whereas a spoof of a reality based cop show could be funny, the team of writers and director Tom Dey (Who made the far superior Shanghai Midday a few years ago; see that movie instead) seem to be on unsure footing, and instead of slamming the TV industry, they really let them off light (The harshest thing they seem to be able to say about network execs is they like to play ping pong at work). Russo's nature has a gleam of fiendish gladness in her eye, but her dialogue and activities rarely teaming the actress' exuberance. <br /><br />With little on screen to keep my attention, my mind launches to roam, and that's dangerous in a movie with this many plot keyholes. For instance; if Showtime (the name given to the cop show) is such a popular smash, why doesn't anyone seem to recognize De Niro and Murphy when they are on the job? For that matter, if their investigation of smuggler and all around mean guy Vargas is being televised, why the heck hasn't someone mentioned to him that they are on his trail? Then again, given this villain's actions maybe I shouldn't be surprised; this is the same joker who is very angry at an associate for using his new supergun without approval, jeopardizing a deal, and then dispatches him how? By using about ten of the superguns to level his entire house, of course! That's like putting out a fire with a bigger fire. <br /><br />Occasionally, Showtime gets laughs, but there simply aren't enough for the film's nearly two hour running time. Even worse, the really smart gags suggest that this movie really could have been on to something, if only they had put in a few more drafts of the script. Murphy mugs and talks as fast as he can with minimal results, and De Niro looks flat out bored through most of this. After a completely unnecessary fistfight between cops and gangsters (That remarkably results in no injuries and no arrests) Russo's character shouts `That's great television!' Perhaps it's great television, but it's far from a great movie.",0
"For all intents and purposes, Showtime was the hardest movie I have ever seen.<br /><br />Why? Because having Deniro in the cast adds immediate credibility and makes you want to watch the movie. I had also made the mistake of watching 48 Hours and Beverly Hills Cop recently before seeing Showtime and for some strange reason thought Eddie Murph was still funny. Well he's not. In fact it almost seems like he has been neutered. As I watched this movie I was in surprise that Deniro decided this was a good enough script to lend his name too. No chemicals between him and Murphy whatsoever. Heinous writing, horrible pranks, a movie that you THINK is supposed to be good can't get much worse than this. Not too long after sitting through the wretch that was Showtime I happened to watch National Security starring Martin Lawrence. The movie had its funny parts but wasn't that great. But still it was 20 time better than Showtime. Please if your a Deniro fan DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!",0
"This 3-hour made-for-TV miniseries came home with us from Blockbuster's this weekend. The production company naturally spent a lot of money on sets, costuming (Bridget Fonda, especially), and special effects (including a great Jim Henson talking polar bear & reindeer). They should have spent a bit more money getting a consistency screenplay. The narratives line was so loose that it really never became jointly. One can overlook Irish-accented Germans, but not herky-jerky storytelling. With senseless loose ends which included a special guest appearance by the Heck, this one is admittedly not destiny to be a Navidad Classic. A disgrace that they wasted good performances by the two female leads.",0
"Sometimes Hallmark can get it right - like The 10th Kingdom - but many of their fantasy films plod, and this falls into the latter category. The version I saw may have been cut (a demon ? shown in the trailer and publicity stills didn't appear), but anything that made the movie shorter can only be a boon.<br /><br />POSSIBLE SPOILERS IF YOU ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE ORIGINAL FAIRY TALE:<br /><br />Anyway, the film updates the story to the early part of the 20th Century (?), and makes Gerda and Kay (here called Kai - being a Lexx fan, I kept expecting him to say, `The Dead do not solve puzzles') 18 year olds. Hans Christian Andersen's basic story is followed: the boy gets a shard of ice in his eye, goes negative, is picked off by the Snow Queen to solve a puzzle in her palace and Gerda goes to find him, having various adventures on the way.<br /><br />As the two main characters are older than in the original, a lot of time is spent getting them together and `in love'. Sadly, I was never convinced that they were particularly in love, and certainly not enough in love to make sense of Gerda's quest. By the time the main plot kicks in, the movie's pace has slowed to a crawl. Alas, when Gerda begins her search for Kai, it only manages to pick up the pace to a leisurely ballad.<br /><br />There are a few odd additions to the story that seem to go anywhere. At the start of the film the Snow Queen kills Gerda's mother, but no explanations for this is given. A polar bear living in the Snow Queen's palace is more than he seems (though this is possibly because the producers realised that the bear's feelings towards the Snow Queen would be OK in a Fairy Tale, but not in a modern film). Again, this is never explained. Also, hints that the Snow Queen has an erotic desire for Kai are dropped, but never followed through. The hyphen is also full of anachronisms that really jar you out of the `fairy tale' ambience.<br /><br />The production looks good, though there is evidence of penny-pinching: the Snow Queen's palace is the hotel where Gerda and Kai lived covered in ice. The three main characters are played with varying degrees of success: Kai comes across as bland as does Gerda initially, but once she sets off to find Kai you warm to her. Bridget Fonda looks great as the Snow Queen, but seems to be in a different movie to everyone else.<br /><br />Ultimately, the film is unsatisfying. It looks good, but drags and lacks magic.",0
"""The Snow Queen"" is based on the famous and very beautiful fairytale by Hans Christian Andersen, about a girl, Gerda, who goes on a dangerous journey to rescue her friend Kai from the clutches of the Snow Queen. This adaption endeavours to capture that story's sense of adventure and luminously intricate imagery through lavish sets and production design, but fails on a number of count.<br /><br />Like so many Trademarks productions, the potential of the story is entirely undercut by heavy-handed scripting and direction. The two actors playing Gerda and Kai are blandly congenial but forgettable; Bridget Fonda as the Snow Quinn looks the part but is otherwise miscast for the role. There's a remarkable shortfall of phenomenal tensile to this meandering three-hour miniseries. At least some of the pacing problems can be attributed to the addition of filler scenes that add very little to the original story, particularly in the opening hour that introduces the main characters.<br /><br />That said, ""The Snow Queen"" would be just about ideal for pre-teens with a liking for fantasy and a bit of patience. It's wondrous eye-candy without being fearsome, and the acting is pitched at the sort of pantomime over-the-top level that periods out the storyline in very, very brave text. Just make sure you read them Andersen's story too.",0
"DANGER: Watch for falling spoilers...<br /><br />Boy, was this a naughty movie. I know that they were going for a ""true love conquers all"" kind of thing, but about all this film conquered was about 3(which felt more like 9) hours of my afternoon which I will never get back. The movie is about two young lovers named Kai and Gerta who live in a remote town in a fantasy world. Kai is the much-abused bellboy at a hotel owned by Gerta's father. At first Gerta ignores Kai's advances but she eventually warms up to him much to the disgust of (You Guessed It!) Gerta's father. As if this obstacle wasn't enough to overcome, an evil snow queen shoots a shard of glass in Kai's eye and he becomes a mean person treats Gerta poorly. Kai is eventually taken to the Snow Queen's fortress (Which is the same set as the hotel just covered in ice, because the good people at Hallmark like to go all out) and Gerta sets out on a mission to get Kai back. Along the way she runs into the 3 other seasons that are evil in their own special way, but Gerta escapes them with the help of some dull and forgettable characters she meets along the way. (All the while you will want to turn it off, but can't force yourself to do it. It's probably the most evil and most effective spells cast by the Snow Queen) Anyways, I will spare you from the ending because anything you can think up in your head right now is probably better then how they ended it. So, in conclusion, the Snow Queen is an tremendously dreary movie, which takes the fan out of fantasy.",0
"Interesting plot but embarrassingly uninspiring. The script lacks... lacks acting. To me this film compares with ""Made for TV"" type movies. I was lucky to survive the film without falling asleep in my popcorn. I watched this film with my family. It is fairly safe to watch with your kids. (only 1 semi sex scene)If you wish to see a young Meg Ryan...check out this movie. Very 80-ish. You will like this movie if you like the combination of depressed people at Christmas, booze, super glue and tar. Or maybe you are like me... and have have a higher standard for acting in films. However I did like the way the movie began and ended! Mark.",0
"I rented this movie primarily because it had Meg Ryan in it, and I was disenchanted to see that her role is really a mere supporting one. Not only is she not on screen much, but anything her character does is key to the plot. Her character could be authored out of the story without changing it much.",0
"As a beacon show, Attacking of the Show (AOTS) is ubiquitous of the larger fall of G4 TV; it is a show (and a station) that has fallen so far that it parade sexuality to try and cover its seeming gaps. Its forerunner, The Screen Savers, was a venue for troubleshooting technology problems and scouting out the latest and greatest in technology. It was a lovely show with a likable staff and it was fun to see some of the modding and other experiences the crew could put to together.<br /><br />The acquisition of TechTV by G4 bothered some longtime fans of the station, but early returns were actually promising. The emphasis on gaming was a lovely addendum and I really enjoyed a lot of the coverage of E3 and other big entertainment events.<br /><br />Unhappily, AOTS now stands as but a shell of its former self. Those overseeing the channel have shifted the focus of the channel away from technology and gaming and toward anything that might elicit drool from young adult men. The upshot is that AOTS spend as much time parading Olivia Munn or touting the adult film industry as it does covering games. It is so unfavorable it is hardly unwatchable.<br /><br />While some may get puerile joy out of this sort of thing, those who genuinely enjoy gaming may wonder where the good coverage went. Equally troubling, young gamers who might tune into G4 thinking their getting gaming - that active gaming group between 10-15 - are instead being fed things aimed toward a more mature audience. On a channel like HBO or Cinemax, things like that are expected. On G4, it's tragic.<br /><br />At least SpikeTV, another male-aimed channel, has good programming like CSI. AOTS, and G4, has very little good left to offer.<br /><br />Too unfavorable, really.",0
"This exhibition is what arrived to The Screen Savers after G4 got its hands on it, taking it from a useful source of computer-related information to a show that had as its high point the shoving of a miniature web server up someone's posterior.<br /><br />As G4's ratings plummeted, they moved away from their original target audience, gamers, to generic hormone-driven young men, adding eye candy to the staff and a sex advice segment. Now even the gamers who applauded the show initially are turning away in distaste. I gaze forward to the show's, and the network's, overwhelmingly overdue and well-deserved downfall.",0
"Since this show was changed from TSS (the screen savers) to AOTS (attack of the show)it has disappearance down hil. TSS with Yoshi and Kevin Rose Alex... etc. Made the show awesome, then they got fired from TSS for an unknown reason. When the show switched to AOTS, it became less about computers, and more about gaming and magazines. It also promoted bands that nobody had heard of, or cared about. Finally I couldn't watch it anymore once Kevin Rose left. He kept it interesting, but he went off to do his own thing, which is good. Kevin Rose now has several online pod casts, and shows, etc on the REV 3 network. Check it out. REV3.com I think, you can get to it by going to www.systm.org. If you want a real tech show rather than aots, then go watch Kevin Roses shows or listen to the tWit podcast.<br /><br />J<",0
"The most accurate description of how Billy Crystal fairs in ""My Giant"" is to say that this movie is to his career as ""Ishtar"" was to Warren Beaty's - it didn't wrack it, but it slowed it down.......a lot. Crystal should know the three golden rules of Hollywood: 1) never play opposite a kid 2) never play opposite an animal 3) never play opposite someone that is almost 3 feet taller than you, is as innocent as a kid and ""acts"" like an animal.<br /><br />What is this story? A farce? I guess, but I didn't laugh, except at the scenes where Crystal is on his own and not burdened with his (what-is-her-role-in-this-movie) ex-wife or the afore-mentioned Giant. Did I mention there's also a kid in this film? Well, forget about him. The son is brought in to make us feel sorry for Crystal, and we do, but for the actor, not the character. Billy Crystal is a amusing man. If you don't believe me, watch him in old episodes of ""Soap"" or ""Saturday Night Live."" Go rent ""City Slicker"" or ""Running Scared"" or ""When Harry Met Sally.""<br /><br />""Giant"" is more ho-hum than fee-fi-fo-fum.<br /><br />",0
"this movie was downright frightful. most of the slapstick scenes seem obsolete and petty, and possibly the funniest scene in the movie had already been given away in previews. the entire hypothesis of the movie is so unbelievable and ridiculous its hard to really get into it. the actors themselves describe the most unrealistic characters. its not just the fact that the kino so hard to swallow, but its how they retain forcing it down your throat expecting you to witless down and accept it. the intrigue itself is so cursory and easy to forecasting. boy someplace gets rejected from every school he applied to(i suppose he completely forgot about attending community college) and decides to create his own school for fellow rejects. all goes well for awhile until the validity of his school comes into question. all the while the dorky character manages to woo his beautiful neighbor into falling for him with his witty sarcasm, which apparently is a skill only he possesses. then comes the final struggle with the students somehow all bonding together and fighting for the survival of the school. of course the main character then persuades the state board of education to allow his school to stay alive with some ""inspirational"" speech. this movie would have been more fun to watch if i was under the age of 16 and still ignorant of all college matters and issues.",0
"The Lifetime chanel circulated this in October but I only got around to watching it now. It's the old eternal trilateral again ¬ó small-town Connecticut boy Dave Ford (Matt Long) has a quick fling with his best friend's girlfriend, Emily Darrow (Emmanuelle Chriqui), on the eve of his departure for law school in New York, thinks about her for the next five years while he isn't doing contracts and briefs, runs into her again when he returns home after the death of his father on the eve of a big exam five years later, and gets involved with her romantically again. But director and co-writer Matthew Cole Weiss goes pathways over the superior, frame the together stuff in flash as Dave confesses to murdering Emily, her husband and another one of her lovers in front of (here comes the spoiler) a Lesbian cop who's also a flame of Emily's. Weiss overdoes the ""flanging"" effect by which Dave gets to see chunks of his previous life flash before his eyes even before he's actually dead, cutting those in even while Dave and Emily are having sex and therefore demolition the soft-core porn punches that give even some alternatively belle lame Vie films at least a bit of audience appeals. I couldn't help but flash back myself to James M. Cain and how much better he texted daughters like this in his classic thrillers (all adapted into hit movies) ""The Postman Always Rings Twice,"" ""Double Indemnity"" and ""Mildred Pierce."" It also doesn't aids that the film ends with the bad guys (the bad girls, actually) triumphal and the decent, if na√Øve and stupid, hero seemingly on his way to the lethal injection table ¬ó or that the protagonists playing the people Dave and Emily are cheating on are both better looking than they are. Incidentally, while this film went straight to cords in the U.S. there were some blank spots on the soundtrack indicating where swear words were blipped, so I presume this gets a theatrical liberating somewhere in the globe.",0
"All I can say is, this movie is made for the Lifetime Channel on TV, which mode no solid characters, no particular styles, vulnerable acting all kinds of recommended sex but no-breasts and tushs (because boy, that would just catapult the cinematography into the depth of sleaze wouldn't it?) but the greatly simulated sex, well, that's OK. <br /><br />When watching these films I have to ask myself, when will these types of TV channels and their advertisers ever grow up? I think these societies are actually way behind the times. They really have no clue what the younger generation is in tune with and if they knew they would demand we change. The whole point of many American TV channels like these seem basically to regurgitate the same sanitized, diluded trash over and over like a generic movie assembly line. I guess it cooperated for them... or at least it has. Not sure about the future though. <br /><br />Don't boring yourself to death like I did. Trying out some real TV movies on HBO, Showtime, IFC, Starz, etc. Everything canals that puts efforts into their working and doesn't have to poser a padre what they can or cannot show.",0
I saw this movie considering this as a normal Hollywood movie but then came to know that its a Movie made for TV channel.On my DVD cover out of 2 critics observations one of the critic stephen farber from moviline reveiwed it as A best filmmaking of the Year..<br /><br />All the character were simple and dignified performances except the Brain's character which never gets scope which director wanted to keeps mystery till end.. there was wait till end but when you see the end that lady Police Officer and main culprit had a Lesbian affair seems to be totally silly idea.God knows what happens to DAVE the male lead character..<br /><br />The other Critic from Mr. Brown's Movies said that Shocking and Effective but doesn't quite live up to all the Hype... which i saw after watching the Movie .for which i was partially aggree...i should have read this first before taking the movie..,0
"I was watching the beginning of this on a Friday, mid-day, while working at computer at home, relaxing a bit after a hectic week, and cleaning-up some files and answering some communications. Got interrupted a couple of times, so had trouble getting all the details straight (although it's hardly a work of Hitchcock proportions, where missing a detail can through the whole story off-kilter), and besides it was not precisely an ""engrossing"" piece of work.<br /><br />So during a commercial, read the only prior comment here (by ""mgconlan-1""), and pretty much can agree with its details.<br /><br />Not quite in the category of a film so heinous it is fascinatingly ""good,"" but I'd like to catch on tape when run again (rather than seeing it as aired), so I can fast forward as needed and see the parts which I missed this first time.<br /><br />Give it a ""3*"" because of the attractiveness of the four primary characters.",0
"It's like someone took a fantasy-type video game and put it in a blender, and the resulting scene mishmash is what we have to seated through.<br /><br />Now leaving me go on recording by saying how much I amore Chinese utopia cinema. From the fun and silly, to those focusing on martial arts, to the more dramatic and sentimental genre¬óit's a genera I very much enjoy. Films like ""A Chinese Odyssey: Pandora's Box"" and ""A Chinese Odyssey: Cinderella"" (both of which were written and/or directed by Jeffrey Lau); ""The Bride with White Hair""; ""Butterfly & Sword""; ""Green Snake""; ""A Chinese Phantom Story""; ""Swordman II""; ""Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain""; ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""; and others. Which is why I was researching forward to ""A Chinese Tall Story."" One of the film's traits is the ""Monkey King"" (aka Sun Wukong), an extremely well-known character in Chinese mythology, first told in the stories of the ""Journey to the West,"" the epic adventure written about 500 years ago. (The story of the Monkey King and his disciples is also the focus of the ""Chinese Odyssey"" films, amongst many others). Other familiar characters that appear in the film are Zhu Wuneng (the pig character) and Sha Wujing.<br /><br />So how does it all go improper? Well, let's take an example familiar to Western listeners. How about the Robin Hood mythology? A well known story from ye olden days. Let's say that our Robin Hood film starred Wesley Snipes as Robin Hood, and Haley Joel Osment as Friar Tuck. Maid Marian is nothingness other than Rosie Perez. Let's give Sir Robin an Uzi as well, because you never know when you might have to waste the Sheriff of Nottingham. They might need rocket packs also, and while we're at it, give them a tactic nuclear arms because that sure could come in handy. If you think this sounds like a really neat retelling of the Robin Hood tale, then ""A Chinese Tall Story"" is the movie for you! As I indicated above, this film is a jumbled confusion. Onto the first 30 mins, we are brought not only to Sun Wukong, Zhu Wuneng, and Sha Wujing, but also to the monk Tripitaka (who is actually the main protagonist), kidnapped children, a ""millennium bug demon"" (which shoots laser beams), an underground Tree God, a lizard imp tribe, an angelic girl in an intergalactic egg, the Lord Chancellor Tortoise, a Sea Dragon King, a ever-morphing magic golden staff, a chatterbox imp girl, wormholes in space, and the Four Heavenly Knights. All this wouldn't be too bad--the tales and myths passed down over the years certainly do have all sorts of fantastical elements. But I guarantee you the Chinese mythology does not include much of the stuff we get subjected to in the last half of the film. (Helpful advice to the filmmakers: Just because your computer effects guys CAN come up with cool looking spaceships and depictions of intergalactic war, does not mean they SHOULD).<br /><br />You know your Chinese mythology movie is on the wrong track when the director asks (and I am not making this up¬óit's a direct quote from the commentary) ""I asked the composer whether or not we can have a more rock-and-roll type music when she transforms into some kind of android-like thing."" Is there a story hidden in here somewhere? Yes. Yes, there is. Most of the adventure follows Tripitaka (played by Nicholas Tse¬ó""Gen-X Cops,"" ""Time and Tide,"" ""My Schoolmate the Barbarian"") and Meiyan, the lizard imp girl (played by Charlene Choi and a computer). Choi is the best thing going in this film. You may know her as half of the Canto-pop group ""Twins"" and from other films such as ""The Twins Effect"" (a fun flick) and ""Just One Look"" (a surprisingly good drama/romance/comedy). Poor Choi, being a lizard imp and all, is hardly recognizable with her warts, snagged out teeth, doughy nose, and hunched back. That is until the computers get a hold of and beautify her, which somehow makes it worse. Tse is passable, but all of the supporting actors were abysmal. A couple of recognizable faces in bit parts are wasted.<br /><br />At one point I was debating with myself if ""A Chinese Tall Story"" was a spoof. I was almost able to convince myself that it was when the intergalactic egg girl (played by a very pretty Fan Bing-Bing) got out and lit up a Marlboro (!) while talking with Tripitaka who was practicing martial arts dressed in a Spider-Man costume (!!). But it is not a spoof. Of course there is the typical Hong Kong silliness, but the movie takes itself seriously enough, with enough scenes of romance and pathos (scored with a sledghammering of violins and evocative cellos) and rousing action and adventure.<br /><br />You might think that you could watch this on a Netflix rental and it wouldn't cost you anything. (Oh, but it'll cost you, all right).<br /><br />Is there anything good to say? Sure. The colors are vibrant (they are the best thing about this movie). And the filmmakers certainly were trying very hard. Too bad all that effort went into a movie that is not much more than a bad video game.",0
"It borrowed scenes from LOTR, Matrix, Star Wars, etc. The humor is so drier, contrived, and corny, that you can't help but laugh occasionally at its inanity and the fact that you are watching it. Exactly what you'd expect from an HK comedy. The average person would enter with an IQ of 100 and leave with less than 80. Stephen Chow is an obvious omission from this movie. The humor would have worked better with Stephen. The Mandarin version of this movie is not as good as the Cantonese original. The graphics are poor compared to its Hollywood counterparts. There is overdependence on low quality CG. My biggest complaint is its ending. The origin of the white horse is so clearly described in the ""Journey to the West"" (JW), that this alternate explanation does not work well with story line. Despite its many gaps this movie has far more entertainments value than the other movie Nicolas Tse starred in--The Promising.",0
"The third film based on Charles Belden's play entitled ""Mystery of the Wax Museum"" (1933) targets generation X-tasy. Twin screenwriters, Chad Hayes and Carey W. Hayes, spend more time developing the main characters than other slasher movies--a promising start. Their stipulation collateral an authentic point of view. The role of Paige (Paris Hilton) was not much of a stretch for the world's favorite heiress. She peruses ""In Style,"" stripteases boys, chats on a cell, and frets over an ill-conceived pregnancy. Her regular routine has been altered beyond repair. Hilton reached the peak of her performance--not so hot--during the ""1 Night in Paris"" (2004) parody. While the pimp-my-ride is in motion, she zealously ""looks for lip balm"" in her boyfriend's (Robert Ri'chard) lap. Finally, the ""actress"" atones for using the ""N"" word on the sex tape. Director Jaume Collet-Serra molds his take on the twin thing contrary to the theme of the past. Each exhibited opposite characteristics back then, whereas a pair of either good or bad can come out the womb today. However, the latter does not rule out the former. Childbirth constitutes the luck of the draw. Spectators can hardly consider Vincent (Brian Van Holt) a contemporary Quasimodo. Granted, the recluses share some similarities such as artistry, disfigurement, submissiveness, and murder. Yet, one small variable between the two makes all the difference. Vincent is even uglier on the inside than he is on the out. Collet-Serra's ""House of Wax"" pays homage to actor Vincent Price from the first remake in 1953. The film leaves obvious van Gogh puns to the imagination of the audience. Still, the choice to split the antagonist in two eliminates a vibrant twist at the end. Professor Henry (Vincent Price) Jarrod's unmasking receives runner-up, but the most scary one in monstrosity movie history belongs to Lon Chaney in ""Phantom of the Opera"" (1925). As far as the new contender is concerned, the aftermath of separation surgery downplays the effect. A surgeon should know operating on Siamese twins scars them--physically and psychologically. Their father needs to call a couple colleagues--Dr. Phil to consult and Dr. McNamara to nip/tuck. Despite what the trailers said, ""Wax"" is not forever. In fact, you can rid yourself of it by burning it.",0
"Omit the extreme voting about ""House of Wax"", in no way is it either a ""1"" or a ""10"". I will strive to be of support to anyone thinking about seeing ""House of Wax"" or for those who saw it based on the caravan and feel deceived. The camper makes this movie look very promising, which is what trailer are supposed to do. There is only one thing for sure with trailers, if the producers can't cobble together a minute of interesting elements to make a trailer, it is a pretty much a sure thing that the movie is a major suck-fest. But a good trailer only tells you that a few things about the movie are good, it does not give you much idea about the total packets. Here a little researches can be valuable. <br /><br />""House of Wax"" superstar Elisha Cuthbert (whose acting skills are tighter to Baroness Ireland than to either her colleagues Canadian Sarah Polley or her lookalike Rose McGowen), and was aimed by a music video artists formerly known as Jaume, in his feature debut. These are not good signalling but if you are like me you ignoring them and go to see the work of Production Designer Grace Walken, who was responsible for the look of ""Phantom Vessel"". Once again Walken's working is worth witnessing, so very so that it looks like 90% of the movie's $30 million budget went to production design. The rest went to Cuthbert to compensating her for the abuse she has to take throughout the film (finger cutting off, lips glued shut, tying up, and lot of wading around in divergent gooey stuff). By-the-bye, Cuthbert looks tremendously tighter than she did in ""The Girl Next Door"", about one considerable pig-out away from having a major weigh problem.<br /><br />Which means they had little left over to pay the rest of the cast and crew. And judging from the what was on the screen, this might actually be true. It looks like everybody else donated their time to get their first acting or crew credit. Sadly, whether it was inexperience or jealousy over the wage disparity, the donations of all these inexperienced/incompetent volunteers amount to less than zero.<br /><br />Inexperienced Steven Window's DP jobs was about as fearsome as you are likely to seeing and worked in league with an incompetent editor like Joel Negran (insert ""Pearl Harbor"" here) they manage to take away most of the value added by the production design group. Rather than linger over and showcase the sets, Window filmed this stuff with bad lighting and jerky-zooming-bobbing camera work. Negran compounded the problem with an insane number of disorienting cuts. Poor lighting, an ADD-like camera, and flurry cutting are what you use to hide cheap and crappy production design; not what is needed when the movie's only strength is its expensive and detailed sets.<br /><br />Chan Hayes did the screenplay and Charles Belden (who wrote the original story) is credited as the writer although except for the title and the use of wax figures there is absolutely no similarity. One saving grace is that the movie does not take itself seriously as a horror film and is mostly parody (insert ""Van Helsing"" here). The murders are played for laughs, too extreme to be scary or even creepy to anyone over age six. The audience particularly cracked up when a certain high profile hotel heiress got her homely face run through by an steel bar, although her earlier half-baked striptease was the only genuinely creepy thing in the film. Another comedy highlight was when Cuthbert sticks her finger through a grate and has it clipped off by the bad guy.<br /><br />The good scenes take place in Trudy's House of Wax, a waxworks that has something to do with a closed sugar mill, conjoined twins, and a lot of roadkill (which Cuthbert gets to bathe in). All this is supposed to be happening somewhere in rural Florida although from the many hills it sure looks like Paul Hogan's country (attention location scouts-the gulf coast is not noted for it's rolling terrain). The screenplay apparently intended to play up the connection (bad pun) between the two sets of twins, but somewhere during production or post-production most of the dialogue concerning this was trimmed. Since what is left about the twin connection makes no sense and goes nowhere, you wonder why it wasn't also cut to reduce the boredom factor.<br /><br />What is particularly sad is that the producers did not have the brains to recognize in mid-production that they had the ingredients for a first rate horror classic-even with the existing cast. What was staring them in the face was a chance to go somewhere with the illusion of a town of wax. Because it is a photographic medium, modern film is intrinsically naturalistic, almost without exception prone to creating an illusion of reality. Here they had a ready-made opportunity to give the photographic medium a theatrical element of extreme stylization. Like an impressionist painting, the town creates the illusion of reality from a distance but reveals itself as a highly stylized wax fabrication up close. Of course they would have had to find a visionary Director and DP to bring the thing off successfully, but everything else was already in place for this to happen.",0
"When they announced this movie for TNT I was excited. A Travesty from Donald Westlake's ""Enough"" was one of my all time favorite stories. After I watched it I was not all that thrilled. Recently I had the chance to watch it a second time with my aunt, and once again I was disappointed (she didn't like it much either, and she'd never read the book). In this movie they managed to sap all the charm from the book and turn it into dull mush. A big part of the difficulties was William H. Macy. I like him fine in other films, but he played (Terry/Carey) Thorpe as a stammering, incompetent yutz. In the book Thorpe takes a lot of valium for his nerves, but remains outwardly collected at almost all times which is part of the fun. SPOILERS follow: They also left out a big part of the story (other than a 2 second glimpse at the embassy), where Thorpe solves not 1 but 4 homicides for the police. This is momentous not just because it's funny, but because it contribute set up the relationship between Fred and Thorpe. In the movie Fred's betrayal in the end is not nearly as affecting, because they don't seem all that close. In the book they become pretty good friends especially on Fred's side, which makes it all the more ironic that he is he one that arranges Thorpe's downfall. Fred also suffered a bit from casting, I love Adam Arkin but he was not a cheerful, happy to be alive upbeat sort of Detective, character traits which book Fred possesses which makes it more obviously out of character for him to mess with evidence and thus more terrifying. Patricia and Edgarson were pretty close to the book, and James Cromwell was great despite not looking much like Martin Balsam. The whole boring boat house scene which was entirely added for the film was much less interesting than the police finding Edgarson's body after Thorpe ships it to Seattle and blaming the death on the mob. Kit was okay although she was mostly rewritten, and it would have been nice to see her die as she did get slightly annoying. I don't mind changes to books to make movies, I know they are necessary because of length and difficulty, but it would have been nice if some of the changes in this movie had been funnier or smarter instead of duller.",0
"As a recent convert to Curb Your Enthusiasm, which prompted my viewing of all season's episodes, I expected more, much more from Jeff's efforts.<br /><br />When I view a film offering a slice of an average 'Joe's' life I need reasons to be interested, to care, to feel and believe. And with Jeff Garlin at the helm I also projected a bevy of glittering comedic moments. This film faulted me time and again.<br /><br />Jeff plays a living with mom, plump sad sack who is a social disaster. He has not had a relationships, real or even casual, for many years. He appears to be mostly unemployed and, as noted, shacks with his mommy dearest. Can things get worse? Sure. In short order he gets fired by everyone around him including Silverman, Second City (his comedy workshop) and his agent. All reinforce his 'loser' status. Silverman's 'fatty' experiences was as cruel as it was absurd. His obsession with the role of ""Marty,"" as the means of his career's salvation, also jolts a big die end.<br /><br />While the film's final moments delivers a glimpse of better things to come the cinematic 'journey,' albeit with occasional golden glimmers, was sadly missing.",0
"Terrific ensemble cast but unfortunately a bunch of undeveloped ideas make the film drag. One feels not fulfilled at the end after waiting for some kind of conclusion, closure, or at least an ironic twist.<br /><br />It had that familiar ""Curb"" feel without dare I say it, Larry as the annoying polar opposite. The music was there, the 'show about nothing' scenes pop up, but without any common thread or suspense - it falters as a solo project that ran out of budget.<br /><br />Spoilers: The movie title speaks about cheese but she prefers the rice pudding. Is cheese a better selling title than rice pudding? He prefers just any junk food, regardless of the sell by date. Maybe I want someone to eat 'cheese-dogs' or ice cream in a pirate suit would have at least tied some scenes together.<br /><br />Marty: this is just not humorous and overdone. People just don't care about a 'show' within a show. A coffee book table about coffee books was funnier.<br /><br />Unless you are big fans of the cast, save your time and eat some cheese. It doesn't even have to be with anyone.",0
"How i merited to watch this baloney??? Meanest ever. The acting was frightful, when i read that this was a farce i expected at least to smile, once - or twice, but....

Yoy can even watch a documentary (if you are a guy) about pregnant women, i guarantee it will be more amusing :)The actor in this one (i forgot his name) is not that rotten, and i am surprised how bye embraced the role.

"This film is about a struggling actor trying to find satisfaction in life, especially love which he has not had a taste of for 5 years.<br /><br />It principally is a film featuring a man with very poor social skills, and he says wrong things all the time. The intrigue is empty and contrived. The main character, James, is lonely, but this theme of loneliness is not properly explored. It is more like an empty statement which other subplots stem from. Sadness and disappointment after being dumped are superficial. There is a weighty lack of feelings in the film.<br /><br />It is not comical as a travesty either. There are some comical one liners but that is it. It missing the happy and uplifting atmosphere to infect people with happy mood. I don't find ""I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With"" humorous.",0
"Why did I buy this movie on DVD?, Well the short responses would be: I really don't know. As for the longer version, it pretty much comes down to the fact that I genuinely like Tatyana Ali and she plays Alicia in this.<br /><br />Now does Tatyana Ali give a genuinely good endeavour in this movie? I must say that it is one of the best, and she is forming up to be a rather dignified actress. I am very much looking forward to see her in action, when better material will be available.<br /><br />This being says, this cinematography was spooky - and my punctuation is given based on this: 1 star for not being the hardest movie I've seen, 1 star for the performance of Tatyana Ali, and 1 star for not thinking that it only deserves 2 stars, there are worse movies for that.<br /><br />Ja Rule should stick to rapping, not my favourite rapper to say the least, but some seem to like him - and if he is contained there, I would be delighted not to see him contaminate the acting scene.<br /><br />Ving Rhames: Ah man, Marcellus Wallace what are you doing here - you used to be cool man. Just because Michael Caine is a fiercely brilliant actor, who has been in so many abysmal flicks as well as good, you don't have to copy him Ving.<br /><br />The rest of the semi big names in the cast: It's OK, there are bills to be paid, and we all have to do things we're not proud of time to time.<br /><br />The movie itself. It so massively flawed, it's pretty difficult to know where to start. It's more like a bunch of scenes thrown in together, as were the director to say ""we need to tell this, and we need to tell that"". There is a story, sadly there is nothing surprising about or within it. To say the least, the plot changes in the story were overly obvious and it was therefore foreseeable what was going to happen all the time.<br /><br />To sum up in one word: Reallynotgood",0
"It is difficult to rate a writer/director's first endeavors. After all, it is one more movie than I have written or directed. James Hunter wrote a story that was interesting, but suffered from an uneven flux.<br /><br />After all, the idea that a man (Ja Rule) has to choose between the thug life and going straight is common, and even falling in love with the daughter (Tatyana Ali) of the man you killed has been done. Doing it again demand somethings that is upfront, and originality is missing in this film.<br /><br />I was lured by the inclusion of so many favorites: Tia Carrere (Trues Lies, Wayne's World), Pam Grier (Jackie Brown), Frank Langella (Dracula, Good Night and Good Luck), and Ving Rhames (Rosewood, Dawn of the Dead). They did not disappoint in their performances, but they had small to work with.<br /><br />Direct to video is becoming more and more common, but that doesn't mean it has to be a waste of time. Maybe the sophomore effort of Hunter will be more congenial.",0

But, early on, it's difficult not to miss the fact that one of the supposedly sophisticated killers purposely twists his foot in some red paint at the murder scene. Sadly, this is not an intricate plot point; and, there are pire histories stumbles afoot. Overall ""Dead Silent"" is not a bad way to spend some time, if there is nothing better on, or you're into Lowe and his co-stars.<br /><br />**** Dead Silent (1999) Roger Cardinal ~ Catherine Mary Stewart, Rob Lowe, Arlen Aguayo-Stewart, Larry Day",0
"The story starts off in the home of a little girl who is going to have a Birthday Party and both the mother and father seemed to act rather quiet and reserved with each other. They proceed to give their daughter her present which is from both of them and it stuck me funny the expressions on the two parents faces as they gave their child this gift, it was almost like, 'I hope she likes it'! There is a killing in the film and Catherine Mary Stewart,(Julia Kerbridge),""Reaper"",2000, gets involved with the case because of family ties. Julia is working hard to become a doctor and this particular murder disrupts her entire life. Rob Lowe, (Kevin Finney),""View From The Top"",03 is a next door neighbor in the same apartment dwelling as Julia and he eventually goes to bed with her and tries to help her in other ways. This is not a bad film, but it is certainly nothing to go mad about, unless you like a film location in Canada and a good looking Catherine Mary Stewart, a native from Canada.",0
"Breathe. I'm puzzled when I see a short like this get attention and assignments and whatnot. I saw this film at a festival before the filmmaker got any attention and forgot about it immediately afterwards. It was slightly annoying to see it swiping the Grinch Who Stolen Christmas heart gag along with the narration, the set design seen many times before, the ensemble vulnerable Tim Burton-ish elegance, and the history that goes everywhere. And we got the ""joke"" about shooting the ravens with the 45 the first time, alright?<br /><br />But I guess what's really inadmissible is that it even swipes its basic concept from a humorous book circa 1999 called LENORE, THE CUTE LITTLE DEAD GIRL by Roman Dirge! As any quick internet search will reveal. I mean, what is this? This is what they base a Hollywood contract on and opens doors in Canada for a filmmaker? ""Give your head a shake"" as Don Cherry might say.",0

"A 10 year old kid fed up with his parents arguing decides to hot wire a car and go on a surreal journey across America to find Motorama cards, which is a gas station card game, that if he can find to spell out ""Motorama"" he has a chance to win 500 million dollars. He meets many surreal character along the way. No one can make an 'instant cult classic', Joe Minion's previous ""After Hours"" achieved that by sheer merit & an striking director, but it wasn't instant. This movie, on the other hand, is just weird just to be bizarre. No poem or reason to any of it. The plot is incidental at finest and seems to existent just to showcase various cameos. It's just not a droll film nor a thoughtful one. It's way too hit together. I've heard many comparisons between this and David Lynch films. That's damn near cult as even Lynch's 'worst' film (meanest in quotes, as he doesn't have an bad films really) is still miles above this dreck. <br /><br />Eye Candy: Cynthia King is topless very briefly <br /><br />DVD Extras: Trailer for ""Joe Dirt'",0
"This peculiarity encompasses Bunuel-like touches, but doesn't preserving one's interest. A 10 year old roams a bizarro America in a stolen Mustang, while the usual cult movie suspects (Dick Miller, Mary Woronov, Susie Tyrell) commit malicious acts in the name of comedy. Like his AFTER HOURS and VAMPIRE'S KISS, the playwright delights in making you squirm. I remained intact, due to the broad acting. You know you're in for it when Meat Loaf and Flea give the most appealing perfs. (And what did this kid's screen test look like? He's insufferable.) Recommended to the dozen or so fans of DONNY BOY ('87).",0
"Some films are off-beat, but nice, but many movies are just mind-numbingly weird. ""Motorama"" fits not-so-nicely in the latter category. Many seem to like it because of endless guest appearances and a total lack of sense, but those two things can only take a movie so far, and ""Motorama"" exclusively doesn't have any other deserves to its credit.<br /><br />""Motorama"" delights itself on intrigue improbabilities. Its main character, Gus, is a cussing 10-year old on a roadtrip across an fictional nationals trying to collect game pieces to win $500 million. When communicating with adulthood digits, none of them seem to notice or be concerned with the fact that he's 10 years old. At first it's tremendously comical, but it speedily become just too amazing, especially considering the people he runs into and the fact that he seems so unfazed by a lot of the bewildering (to someone that age) photo going on around him. Gus has no depth, and, as an anti-hero who has no problem causing misery for others to get his game pieces, it's hard to feel sorry for him when he encounters trouble.<br /><br />That troubles is provided by a slew of guest phenomena, each mistreating Gus in more and more weird ways. Besides making the already worn-out intrigue even more fabulous and less pleasurable, the characters share Gus' lack of depth and are equally unmemorable. The character's actions can get a little interesting, but the actors themselves don't add anything to them, thus negating the whole point of getting big surnames (they could've been played by anyone and the character would've been the same). These houseguest phenomena seem to have been subscribed more for marquee value than anything else.<br /><br />""Motorama"" should be interesting - it's a unique idea, but there's too little semblance of sense in the hyphen for it to work. Occurrences that should have a permanent repercussions on the anti-hero and the beholder don't, as the movie punctually moves from incident to incident, in the esperanza that something will eventually make the audience feel sorry or understanding for Gus. That never happens, as by doing so nothing is allowed to connect, it just jerks back and forth as if on a conveyor belt, one incident after another. With a story so nonsensical it ceases to be enjoyable, and a main character who never evolves to care for himself or anyone else on a higher level, ""Motorama"" has little to offer except a brat sneaking around and trying to get rich. Why should we care about that?",0
"I don't know what the manufacturer of this film were trying to either accomplish or say, but they badly failed at whatever it was. Unless of course the object was to wholly confuse the beholder. I observed this film simply because Drew Barrymore was in it, and it transformed out that she had a smaller than small cameo in it. The ensemble inkling of having this kid go on some wild car trip to win a big money prize from a gas station game and meet up with all sorts of wackos is quite nonsensical.",0
"I did not quite get Barnens O ¬ñ it is one of the weirdest ones I have watched. The soundtrack was quite exceptional as well ¬ñ written and performed by Jean Michel Jarre - it makes the movie weirder than it was. I have to admit that I was almost going to change it and watch another one instead ¬ñat times the movie sounded plain dumb to me, or tiresome ¬ñ or confusing. There are quite a few sexual references in that movie ¬ñ trough they too are kind of messed up . Probably the only phrase that I will remember out of it is going to be ""When you are alone, you can control things ""¬ñ and ""I will show them ""- or something like that .The boy in that movie was obsessed with the idea of not growing up ¬ñ ""the last summer as a child ""he thought once ¬ñ and he sure resided it to the maxie.

"Occasionally it is comical to watch movies implode from your sofa, but other dates it is just terribly painful to both your eyes and your mind. House Party 4: Down to the Last Minute is one of those rare instances of when both your eye and your intellect are pleading with you to turning the cinematography off. This definitive installment to the Houses Parties series is by far the hardest, not just sequel, but film liberated by Hollywood. It becomes very evident early on in this ""attribute"" that director Chris Stokes love Ferris Bueller's Day Off with a passion. I says this because it becomes very clara that Stokes had no problems lifted the originality of Bueller off Giovanni Hughes' hands and opted to creating a cinematography entirely void of comedy. You would thought that by ""stealing"" topic and picture from a funnier film, your own film would at less be able to generate a joke or two. With House Part 4, Stokes proved that he does not have what it takes to direct a sequel, much less a Hollywood films. From his confusing and turbulent histories, the disability to make feeling of his characters, and reclaimed old/tired clich√© moments, all Stokes is doing is hitting a bigger nail into the coffin that holds the House Part films. It reminds me of that student that forgets about his project due in an hour and quickly slops together super glue, macaroni, cat hair, chewing gum, and straws and presents it as ""Hannibal Crossing the Alps"". It just looks horrible and you feel embarrassed for the creator.<br /><br />So, where did this film first take the plunge into the realm of comic stupidity? Honestly, I do not think that most places will allow me to speak that long, so instead I would like to hit upon some of the larger topics that hit me the hardest. To begin, I still cannot shake the Ferris Beuller rip-off. It was as if director Stokes was ashamed of having to direct another sequel to House Party and decided to bring in a completely random formula (from a funnier film) and see if he could cut and paste elements from the original series into that formula. That was a huge mistake. When a director tries to do this, what eventually happens is confusion within the audience. We think that we are going in one direction, but instead we head in another one. That is exactly what you can witness in House Party 4. In one instance we have John-John trying to have the ""biggest party of the decade"" while also trying to score a record deal (ok, kinda reminds me of the original House Party), but then we whisk away to this random island where Uncle Charles is afraid of flying, Grandma gets drunk, and some idiotic mind-dulling moments with a supposed killer. Again, we begin somewhat strong, and end chaotic. This is the confusion in which I speak. Director Stokes did not have the ability to keep his hand on either the pulse of humor or the ability to tell a sequential story. He would rather cut corners, keep the jokes cheap, and think that the audiences are idiots than attempt to revive a stone-dead series. One would think that when a director was handed that task of filming another House Party film he would walk into it thinking that he/she would be the one to revive it or bring it back to life, instead Stokes just wanted to get paid.<br /><br />I realize that I am slowly growing older as the days go quickly by, but I do believe I still keep my hand in the younger generation's culture. I listened to rap and R&B growing up, but the group ""Immature"" never made it to either my cassette deck or my CD player. Why? I don't think they ever quite had a following, but apparently to director Chris Stokes, it would be beneficial to cast them as leads in his new House Party film. Didn't anyone at any studio realize that this was going to be in the red rather quickly? Or how about the option to have Stokes himself play the comedic car repairman, nothing like a director with no sense of comic timing casting himself as the only source of possible humor. It was one of those few instances when I actually missed Robin Harris, and I never thought I would find myself saying that to any film. Outside of a go-nowhere band playing the lead role, I also thought that the remainder of the cast only continued to suck the life out of this film. Uncle Charles was annoying when he attempted humor. Kim Whitely was completely wasted for her scenes (both literally and figuratively) while ¬Ö well ¬Ö everyone else pretty much falls into that category.<br /><br />Where did Chris Stokes spend most of the budget for this film? Not for special guest stars because while this film may have boasted some, there were definitely none present at the ""unforgettable"" House Party, nor the possible dream that perhaps Kid or Play would make one final appearance. House Party 4 followed no preset design, which ultimately ruined this feature from the foundation down. Can anyone explain to me why there was any need to use the ""escaped murderer who happened to be a licensed taxicab driver"" routine for humor? Stokes was reaching deep within the bottom of the barrel and only produced more muck instead of substance. For once I can admit to there being no redeeming value to this film. House Party 4 buried the series, and while I do hear that there may be more in the pipeline, I only hope Hollywood realizes that this series has died. Hollywood needs to let this series end, forget about the past and move forward in the future. I think a sequel to Who's the Man? would get them started in the right direction.<br /><br />Grade: * out of *****",0
"Let me first start with the obvious: antisemitism has been a serious problem throughout history, present in many societies and causing the deaths of million of Jews. That said, the difficulty with this movie is that it vistas the United States - probably the most welcoming society ever to Jews outside of Israel - as a not very different place from Nazi Germany. Set in 1943, the movie is about a man (William H. Macy) who gets confused with a Jew after he starts wearing glasses!. A number of very dirty things happen to him after that (he loses his job and he is unable to find a new one, his neighbors shunned him, all ending up in a violent confrontation). From one of Arthur Miller's self pitying, patronizing novels, the sort that gave liberalism a bad name.",0
"I am a fan of a few of the Vacation films, but when a movie franchise goes from the big screen to the TV screen, you know it's out of steam. Made for TV National Lampoon films do not do well on TVS. This movie is another reason.<br /><br />I think a lot of us were excited when this was coming out, but we also had to face the realism...it's a TV movie. Randy Quaid is fine as Cousin Eddie, but is better in a supporting role than the lead. Dana Barron sets history as the first actor to reprise her role as one of the Griswold kids. She is just as quite, but it doesn't supporting a thin hyphen. <br /><br />Why was this cinematography even made? It was probably because NBC recently picked up another few years of presenting X-mas Vacation. There is nothing wrong with the acting. It's all in the hyphen. It's just not that comical. People need to think before they write stuff like this. It is one Christmas movie I do not recommendations.",0
"I loved the original, I watch it every year. but the second is a piece of trash and it never should have been made. The second could have worked if there was a different location. The son was not an original or didn't even act like one of Eddie's kids. Third was too smart for Eddie which downplayed his father role. None of the other kids where in it. It just could of been a lot better. I don't know why they even tried to make this movie. There was no continuncy from the first movie. I will pretend that this one doesn't even exist. It is sad that the players didn't even see that they where made fools of. A really wicked movie. I just think that i wasted an hour or more on a wicked movie and i really adored all of the national lampoon film.",0
"I was out-of-town, visiting an old friend. After dinner, talking, he expressed some reservations about his daughter's boy friend. She's 15, beautiful, smart, athletic, and the young man is also from an excellent family, nice, also athletic (if not as smart). I told him he might just be feeling the normal fatherly concerns; however, a few minutes later the young man arrived, with his DVD of this flick, which he had apparently been anxious for some time to share with the others. <br /><br />These folks have a bona fide home theater set-up, with a screen something in excess of 4 feet, and the two young folks preceded to view it, while the young swain proceeded to extol its virtues almost frame-by-frame.<br /><br />I saw enough in a few moments (and with some fascination in its awfulness) to endorse all of the most critical comments I've seen in scanning some here.<br /><br />I told my friend I wouldn't go so far as to disqualify the young suitor solely on the basis of his liking this opus -- but it certainly seems to warrant his bearing close watch.<br /><br />Some flicks are so-bad-they're-good: the classic ""Plan 9 from Outer Space;"" and, in my opinion, the wonderfully frightening Bruce Jenner/Village People work, ""Can't Stop the Music.""<br /><br />However, this one remains firmly simply in the frightening class.<br /><br />Second/third/fourth ""bananas"" -- even the best of these (e.g. Tim Conway, Don Knotts, everybody with Seinfeld) have great difficulty in carrying a later starring series (or, as here, film). And these were wondrous supporting characters in their original situations.<br /><br />The ""Eddie"" character, really at about the 5th- or 6th-banana level in the prior Griswald movies, and never added a whole lot to these, in my opinion. Randy Quaid is a capable actor who has delivered some good performances. His contribution to the prior ""Vacation"" pic's was average, at best. Both he and the other cast members, many of whom have done some good work in the past, accomplished nothing for their efforts here, except to derive a few years' house payments or some IRA contributions.<br /><br />This whole presentation --- story, performances (from lead to support) couldn't be worse.",0
"It'll be a blue Christmas indeed if you subject you're family to this. I love the upfront movie, and this one was not worthy of being its sequel. Actually, for all intents and purposes, it is not its sequel. Only one character from the original cast returns. Granted, that character happened to be the hilarious cousin Eddie, but he simply is not hilarious being the protagonist of a movie. His niche is that of the wacky relative who performs zany antics--alongside Chevy Chase. Chevy Chase was needed in this film for it to be a success, and he definitely was not there. As far as I am concerned, a movie is not a ""Vacation"" movie unless good ole' Clark Griswold is at the helm.",0
"When i found out there was a Christmas Vacation 2, I couldn't wait to buy the DVD. I sent off my money and watched it as soon as it came through the letter box. I love all the national lampoons films with Chevy manhunt in it, and I bet he was glad he wasn't in this one!. I couldn't reckon how wicked this was, you would think it was impossible not to laugh at a national lampoons film, but believe me it is! . This film probably looked like a good idea on paper having cousin Eddie as the main character, he started to get on my nerves from early on in the film, and became abundantly unfunny by the middle of the film, and by the end of the film i had gone brain dead and couldn't remember what had happened! .",0
"Dorry Randy. I adored your comedy but in this instances you genuinely laid a 'Golden Turkey' egg.<br /><br />The plot was finer than a single layer of my skin, the acting more wooden than a Monumental Redwood and I think the directorate was non existent.<br /><br />There arguably appeared to be unhappy endeavors at take-offs of other movies, Jaws and European Holiday to behalf but two.<br /><br />If memory serves me right Eric Idle played the same type of character in Nat Lamp European Vacation, but much best.<br /><br />I am requested if Chevy Chase and Beverley D'Angelo were approached to make this sequel. If so, they certainly knew what they were doing when they turned their parts down.<br /><br />In my opinion no one can better Chevy and Beverley in their duties as the Griswolds and Randy Quaid complemented them admirably in the earlier films.<br /><br />Randy Quaid should have quit National Lampoon whilst he was ahead.",0
"I saw Naughty Little Things as part of the ""8 Films To Die For"" Horrorfest, and this was the only movie that disenchanted me. To witt, a mom, her little girl and her teenage daughter settle down in an abandoned house in the Pennsylvania mountains. Every night, yet, the vengeful liquors of children killed in a coal mine run about and slaughter anyone they find.<br /><br />I guess the director was banco on his spectators being repulsed that children would be capable of pickaxe murders and eating human flesh (of which there are lavish close-ups, as a nice homage to George Randall) because the film just isn't fearful else. Straightforward put, there are far too many establish shots of the evil enfants jogging to their next murder site. If someone's gonna get it in the barn, there will be a shot of the kids ARRIVING at the barn (oh the suspense) and then moving in for the kill.<br /><br />Come to think of it, why do the kids suddenly walk SO SLOWLY when they corner their prey? And not that I have any experience in this, but I think a gun blast will throw a child A LOT FARTHER than this film implies...? Nor does it help that the mom is one of the hardest parents I've ever seen in any film. ""The lock on the front door is busted""? You have an EIGHT-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER in the WOODS with BEARS and MOUNTAIN LIONS! FIX IT, you MORON!!! Plus, Mom and her oldest daughter look waaaay too close together in age- even for a teen pregnancy, and there's a pretty fantastic mortality which involves sneaking up on somebody trying to push a car out of the mud with their butt.<br /><br />I'm giving this a 3 because it attempt. As a splatter film it's not bad. But for good terrifies, go elsewhere.",0
"In 1913, in Carlton Mine, Addytown, Pennsylvania, the cruel owner of a mine uses poor children in the exploration and after an explosion, a group of children is buried alive. On the present days, Karen Tunny (Lori Heuring) has just lost her husband after a long period of terminal disease when the family savings have been spent in the treatment. Without any money, she moves with her daughters Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and Emma (Chloe Moretz) to an old house in the mountains that belonged to her husband. Karen is advised by her neighbors to stay at home in the night, and Sarah hears that there are zombies in the area. When Emma becomes friend of Mary, he mother believes she is an imaginary friend. However, when Sarah's friends are attacked and eaten alive by zombie children and Emma vanishes, Karen and Sarah chase her nearby the mine.<br /><br />""Wicked Little Things"" is not a abundantly unfavorable movie: the acting is good; the make-up is creepy; and the filmmaking and the music score are wondrous. Conversely, the story, and consequently the scenario, are very fragile, indeed a unfavorable collection of clich√©s. The beginning is reasonable, with a widow moving to a house in a remote location because the family spent all their resources with the illness of the patriarch. But when she arrives, coincidently the little zombies attack people without any consequences, for example, families do not search the missing persons. Then the wicked Mr. Carlton comes to the place with the most disgusting attitudes, a typical clich√©s that he will die in the end. There is no explanation why the children attacked innocent people and why they should stop after killing Mr. Carlton. When Sarah is running away with her mother and says that she is tired and cannot run anymore, it is one the most stupid lines that I have ever seen in a horror movie. My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): ""Zombies""",0
"If you described any of the scenes; nightmares of children murdering you in your sleep, your infant daughter talking to ghosts, searching for your lost child in an abandoned mine at night, so petrified with fear that you can't move even though the blood from a murder victim is dripping onto you from the floor above ¬ñ then I'd say you had a horror movie. But some how 'Wicked Little Things' just wasn't spooky. I am a horror fan and I loved the location, the plot in principal and I liked the three leading ladies. I didn't want to see them come to harm, I wanted the 'bad guy' to get his just desserts, the rest of the cast are always simply cannon fodder so I was impassive either way with them and it accomplished out every clich√© in the book - even down to the torch battery running out in the pitch dark just as you start to here whispering voices closing in on you.<br /><br />I would still recommend that you watch it, but unless you are new to horror movies or under 12 years, you will have seen it all before.",0
"The concepts of this movie is pretty compelling: zombie children climbing out of an abandoned mine to seek revenge for their deaths in the backwoods of Pennsylvania. Cool. The troubles I had with the movie is the lack of imagination when dealing with the zombies. The maker could have really spiced this film up with some terror-like imagery a la ""The Ring"" such as stop action, reverse camera walking or stuff like that. When the zombie children are strolling through the woods they look like a bunch of 9 year-olds walking to a playground in West Philadelphia. Instead of pick axes and shovels they could have easily been carrying baseball bats and gloves. Why would I fear these little kids? Anyone could just run away in a straight line to safety. Also, who in their right mind would have stayed one night with their children in that creepy, run-down house? The moment I opened that front door and looked around I would have said, ""Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Son, go start the car. I'm going around back to pee on a bush and then we're out of here."" Totally phenomenal movie. Don't waste your time.",0
"All I would thought while watching this movie was: ""Will it ever end?!"" It was unbearably boring to watch. I was wanting I would just turn it off, but I wanna to do this inspect justice so I fight the good struggling and withstood the tortures of staring this movie all the way through so that you, the good reader, need not bear that heartbreak also.<br /><br />This movies sounds iike it has a magnificent supposition if you read the assumption on paper. Conversely, the real cinematography does not provide on this supposition at all.<br /><br />The opens scene features a mineshaft in the early 1900's, where they are forcing juvenile to carry dynamite into the tunnel that aren't big enough for the adults to fit into. This seems to be setting up the assumption for an interesting kino. But after 4 minutes, it becomes unmistakable that is not the lawsuits. The adults who committed these criminality are never punishing; there is no impacts revealed in the movie for their actions. The opening scene is way better than, and completely irrelevant to, the rest of the movie. The last time an open scene misrepresented a cinema so grievously was the opening scene of 28 Days Later which was the only alright scene in *that* whole movie. Wicked Little Things/Zombies (a cinema so crap they changed the title to try to conceal it's crappiness and sold it again) is accurately the same in this regard. The opening scene is the only watchable scene in the ensemble movie.<br /><br />However, the cinematography blinks forward to present-day. A sole momma and her two bratty, foul-mouthed kids. Right here is when it would have been wise to journalism the CEASE button and never go near the movie again.<br /><br />In the fiirst hours, the ghoul youths are hardly yet watched. They get maybe 3 minutes of screen-time, total. All they do is kill a porker, that's it. The repose of the hours is spends exhibiting the foolish mama and her imbecile juvenile buy things at the local store, roam roundabout the forestier, and have petty speaks with each other. The dumb teenage giri goes and hangs out with some other imbecile adolescence and smokes weed with them.<br /><br />There would be no reason to care at all if the zombie kids dispatched anyone in this movie. Every single character is both dumb & annoying, with no redeeming qualities at all. Not to mention one-dimensional and clich√©d.<br /><br />This movie would have been *vastly improved* if the mother and her dumb kids were dispatched in the first 10 minutes by the zombie kids, as they were driving up to their new house, then the end credits rolled. That right there would instantly change the score from 1/10, to 10/10. Honestly! When the dumb mother takes her eyes off the road and almost crashes into a pedestrian on the road, her daughter scolds her: ""You almost killed us, mom!"" Of course, anyone with common sense knows that if the mom had hit the pedestrian, it would be the pedestrian who would be dead --- not the people safely encased *inside* the car. I guess this line was put into the movie to show firsthand that the utter stupidity of the main characters knows no bounds, and runs in the family.<br /><br />Wicked Little Things/Zombies runs for 1 hour and 34 minutes, but it definitely felt like 5 hours or more to me. Trying to not fall asleep was a tremendous challenge. It's not until over an hour has passed into the 1 hour and 34 minutes that the zombie children actually bother to kill any person. Then the scene shows the dumb teenagers drinking beer and making out in a car and saying lines like, ""If you ever wanna get in my pants again, you better start the car and get my ass out of here right now."" Seriously, that's verbatim from the movie. The teenagers are so clich√©d, one-dimensional, badly-acted, dumb & annoying that when the zombie kids finally get around to hacking 3 of them up 1 hour and 5 minutes into the movie, it feels like a cause for celebration. Of course the ""Princess"" dumb weed-smoking foul-mouthed beer-drinking loser daughter of the main mother character gets away scott-free. What a buzzkill that was! She was on the screen longer than the others and hence the most annoying of the 4 of them, and most deserving of a pickaxe to the head. All the more reason why she should have been dispatched within the first 10 minutes, as aforementioned. To still keep her around past 1 hour and 5 minutes though, is totally inexcusable.<br /><br />The reason for this of course is that feature length movies need to be padded to at least 1 hour and 30 minutes. So by keeping her alive long-past when she should be, they have an extra 27 minutes to pad the movie with her and her mother running through the woods. By 1 hour and 22 minutes in, it's the *second* time in the movie where the annoying daughter is trapped in a vehicle where the engine won't start whilst the zombie kids are coming to get her.<br /><br />The zombie kids are completely generic. Never say anything. No character development at all for any of them.<br /><br />In the end, all 3 of the annoying, idiotic main characters live. Which in my opinion, is the filmmakers' way of giving a final flipping the bird gesture to the viewing audience. In my opinion, the filmmakers surely know that they have bamboozled anyone who has had the great misfortune to watch the whole movie. Why not rub their faces in it by not even giving them the satisfaction of seeing any of the 3 main characters who should have been dispatched within the first 10 minutes, die.<br /><br />Avoid Wicked Little Things/Zombies like the Bubonic Plague.",0
"I ordinarily adored this sorts of film. Instead, this time I found myself wanting to kick the screen. Since I can't do that, I will just moan about it. This was altogether foolish. The things that happen with the dead kids are very groovy, but the alive people are absolute fools. I am a grown man, pretty big, and I can defend myself well. However, I would not do half the stuff the little girl does in this movie. Also, the mother in this movie is reckless with her children, to the point of neglect. I wish I wasn't so angry about her and her actions because I would have otherwise enjoyed the gesture. What a number she was, take my notifying and fast forwards through everything you see her do until the end. Also, is anyone else getting sick of watching movies that are filmed so dark. Anymore, one can hardly see what is being filmed. As an audience, we are impossibly involved with the actions on the screen. So then, why the hell can't we have night vision?",0
"I really wanted to like this movie. A film with zombie children getting out of a mine to kill people at night really seemed like a great idea for a horror film. Regrettably, the film was in the bottom 3 of films accomplished at horror fest.<br /><br />A mother and her two daughters attempt to move on after her husband/father had passed away from an illness that cost their family a lot of money. They have to adapt to their new environment. They end up struggling due to all the environments for different reasons.(Mad Ghoul kid go into this category) The film never gives any sentimental attachment for anyone that lives or dies, the film generates no alarms or jump meritorious moments, the film hardly showing the infantile doing what they're supposed to do...Murdered! With a bigger budget and a better casting this film could have hope. Until then, pass on it.<br /><br />3.5/10 genuinely.",0
"Wicked Little Things (known in Australia as ""Zombies"") is a seldom find ¬ñ a film that promises one thing but provides another. It is one of the few genre films to be made by Millennium Pictures, a European film studio known for making various B-grade action films & thrillers, some featuring action star Jean-Claude Van Damme.<br /><br />Karen Tunny & her two daughters Sarah & Emma arrive in the Pennsylvanian town of Addytown in order to move into a large house that Karen's late husband owned after finding a miner's deed in his effects. Once arriving, they find that the house is very old & in need of repair. But the house's condition is the least of their problems, as they discover that the area is prone to disappearances & Karen is confronted by the area's owner & ordered to move out. Once night falls, the Tunnys unearthed out the reason behind the vanishings: a group of zombie children, killed in a mine collapse in the area more than 85 years ago, come out to kill anything that goes in the woods. With the help of a grizzled neighbour, Karen attempts to end the curse before her & her children become the next victims.<br /><br />I bought the DVD expecting a film with flesh-eating zombies, but was leaving down by one thing: the film is more akin to a ghost story than your usual zombie flick, with the dead children being the embodiment of a curse that haunts the woods, taking their revenge on anything that moves around at night (although the internal logic is somewhat flawed ¬ñ the children can only be appeased by the sacrifice of animals & are repelled by blood wards on doors in the same manner that vampires are repelled by garlic & mirrors ¬ñ aren't these kids supposed to be zombies?). The plot as such would not be a problem & would actually be entertaining, but the main problem is that the producers adapted a script with the intention of making a zombie film, only to decreased flat on their faces with this effort.<br /><br />As such, a film like this would be aight as a ghost story but, due to a poor hyphen, become anything more than an entirely normal effort. The film's most strength is the acting, with the cast giving best performances than the film deserves. Of particular note is Scout Taylor-Compton, who does her role quite well ¬ñ it's a shame she ruins her genre cred with a very poor performance in the HALLOWEEN remake (or maybe it's just Rob Zombie's script).",0
"This launches off in Pennsylvania in 1913. A bunch of kids are killed in a mine explosion purposely set off by the mine's owner. Slice to 2006. Recently widowed Karen (Lori Heuring), her teenage daughter Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and little girl Emma (Naomi Moretz) move to a remote house located near that mine. What they don't know is the ghosts of the little kids haunt the woods and kill anyone who's around after dark.<br /><br />Slower and bored ""abomination"" cinematography. The assumption is apparent and has been done to death already. Also there are tremendous drawbacks in logic in the history. It's never made clear why these kids just kill anybody or why they EAT the bodies afterwards (Yes--it's exhibited). They're dead already--why do they need food? And why haven't they gotten the main villain in the story long before? He was around the area. Why pick this time to attack him? Apart the nature aren't the least bit likable. Sarah comes across the worst. It has a few rescued wonders. The positioning is terrific and eerie at the same time, some of the killings were VERY bloody and brutal and the kids themselves seemed spooky silently walking through the woods at night. But, all in all, I was drilled and fight to staying awake. You can skip this one.",0
"Director J.S. Cardone presented something a little horrible and a little spooky, but anything more. A widowed mother Karen Tunny(Lori Heuring)inherits a home in the Pennsylvania mountains; so she takes her two daughters and moves into the sprawling estate in what seems the middle of nowhere. But it is somewhere, somewhere ninety some odd years ago a tragic mining accident claimed the lives of numerous children who were forced to labor in the dark and dank. The area and especially the Tunny estate seems to be obsessed by the wits of the little little inclement souls. The legend is the screaming children come out in the moonlight to seek their revenge; and you better believe it. Also in the cast: Ben Cross, Scout Taylor-Compton, Chloe Moretz, Julie Rogers and Geoffrey Lewis.",0
"With Hong Kong heart-throb Andy Lau and veteran star Ching Wan Lau, ""Aau Chin"" has everything going for it for the beginning part of the movie, unfortunately, the movie falls apart at the end.<br /><br />Andy Lau plays a sophisticated thief who only has 4 weeks to live, but still has one thing unfinished... He pulls an elaborated scheme tricking the police into helping him... However, the police is hot on his tail.... Can he pull it off before being caught?<br /><br />The build up of the movie is good. Bits of pieces of clues are left behind for the audiences to try to guess at the real intention. Sadly, the build up leads to a frustrating final confrontation. It feels as if in the middle of the script, the writer has changed and that all the build-up becomes disconnected.<br /><br />A 3/10 ....",0
"Well, I notice IMDB has not offered any plot info...that's because it's not possible to do that without sounding vile and disgusting...because that's what this film is...VILE AND NASTY !! I watched it because I am a humongous Fan of Chris Noth, whom I have met in person and he is a great guy...but if I ever meet him again, I will have no qualms about asking him whatever posessed him to superstar in algo so heinous. He plays a former child prodigy who is now a brilliant doctor, who spends his spare time running over small children with his car, with the intent of maiming and crippling them...this is not a ""spoiler"", because all this is made very lucid from the begining...revolting enough?? Oh, it got better...he is handled into doing this, by his incestuous sister, who threatens to with-hold sexual favors from him if their latest victim fails to die...even Clive Barker couldn't write anything so heinous. Invite, if you want to see Chris Noth in something worthy of his talent, tenancy ""Teddy Roosevelt and The Roughriders""",0
"Horrific in a bad/good way...this movie has solemnly become the gravest ""made for TV movie"" in my book...except for the camp value it offers, I give it a 1 in quality and a 10 for the camp value. Recommendation: Watch with friends, champagne and plenty of popcorn...you'll want to throw some at the screen! Preferably friends who like Chris Noth from his 'Sex in the City days'...this movie is terrifyingly fun. This is decidedly the minimum point in the careers of all cast members...honestly, I don't know how they controlled the laughing as the lines were delivered! Daniel J. Travanti is totally pathetic. EVERYONE participated in the school of over acting; and poorest Joan Van Ark, I believe she was the only one picked this theatres of the absurd severely...she is credited as a producer though. Her ""Mom"" jeans and bad plastic surgery are scene stealer's. This movie also crosses the oh so delicate line of social incorrectness when they introduce a mentally challenged character into the plot. This is an obscure movie showing on Lifetime listed as {With Harmful Intent}....has anyone else had the glee?",0
"We have given this film one star for awful, however, it really depends on how you look at it. We are currently watching this on Channel 5 at 3.30am, and we haven't stopped laughing, so perhaps we could give it a 10, just for the entertainment value. Right from the outset, with the 'manic' thoughts of the stalker being relayed in comic fashion, we were laughing. Is it me or does that chick from Knott's Landing look like one of the characters from the Dark Crystal.<br /><br />I'm not going to spoil it for you, however, you would have to be pretty stupid not to see it coming, i don't think its clever enough for double bluffs.<br /><br />This has to be the gravest/best film we have ever seen, if we'd been playing the 'spot the clich√©' drinking game, then we be wasted by now.",0
"This series pick a classic storytelling and makes litter of it. Robin is somehow mystified by an elk-man in the forest and is embroiled in all sorts of druidism and outright satanic episodes. The story is more about him avoiding the evil sheriff than helping the poor. This is hardly watchable. And to superior all the ridiculousness they kill Robin at the end of series 2 and replace him with another actor. Some people may like this show as a fantasy show but it is NOT a Robin Hood show. If you want Robin fighting in king Richards name against Prince John and the sheriff and if you want Robin feeding the poor and oppressed, watch the classic series or the newest from the BBC.",0
"I must admit, I was against this movie from the beginnings but I tried my hardest to be impartial, I really did, but the very idea of remaking a sophisticated, witty, entertaining, quirky British classic full of character has to be shady from the start.<br /><br />People in my house were watching this so I consumed my pride and told myself to be professional about films (I have studied them at Uni after all).<br /><br />As expected for an American film of this sort, the movie inaugurated with a chase which wasn't unhealthy. Indeed, many of the action sequences are believable and this alone lifters the marks.<br /><br />Yet the characterisation was abysmal, the set-pieces could very easily have been spliced from any American schlock blockbuster you might have had the misfortune to watch and it lack all personages.<br /><br />Seeming to take a skewed angle on the original film with a failed initial robbery, the US version does the predictable thing and introduces an emotional factor with the death of Donald Sutherland's character. This allows our US cousins plenty of opportunity for sycophantic, dewy-eyed vengeance-seeking against the 'evil-doers' which it milks to predictable excesses. This is never more so evident as in the scenes featuring Charlize Theron (oh pretty! oh so pretty! Look at her pretty, wounded Bambi eyes, everyone!) which were thoroughly disgusting. Her entrance scene, particularly, was like something out of Resident Evil or Tomb Raider which were both a) more entertaining and b) had better beginnings because they couldn't mess up a game like they could with British cinema which was already chock-full of spark, people you genuinely feel something for and moments of inspiration. But I digress, the whole inclusion of a pretty girl for the sake of it just seems like the most ham-fisted manoeuvre I've seen in some time and exposes cynical Hollywood blockbuster-lust for what it is.<br /><br />If you like any of these actors, by the way, and you agree with any of the above sightings, DO NAH GO TO SEE THIS FILM! If I had the opportunity of watching 'Fight Club' or 'American History X' after seeing Ed Norton in this, I would have declined. Similarly Jas Statham with 'Lock Stock' (and I suppose 'The Transporter' is okay if you like that sort of thing).<br /><br />Sadly, all the set-pieces are designed in the most transparent possible way to get you thinking, 'Wow! He's smart!', 'Coo! He's cool!', 'Hey! What a tough guy!'. Then there's the 'funny PC guy' who has 'comic relief' splattered across his forehead but whose humour content can be anticipated two minutes in advance. To be honest, if you've seen one or two films like it, you might easily confuse the two as clones from the Jerry Bruckheimer stable. Not that Jerry is irredeemably awful, by the way, but he just uses the clich√©s to excess as everyone knows (or should).<br /><br />This is where I have to come clean. I didn't manage to make it to the end, so I couldn't even say whether the brilliant ending in the Michael Caine version made it but, I'm sorry, it's just one of those extremely rare films that, if I'd seen it at a cinema, I would have walked out and staged a small protest outside. It's not just that it is another identical by-the-numbers Ocean's 14 or something (Ocean's Eleven was fine but don't bother with the rest!) with all the glitz, glamour, fake sass and pantomime heroics of such a film but I couldn't recognise anything from the original at all.<br /><br />So, if you are expecting 'THE Italian JOB' and not 'OCEAN'S 14' albeit badly written with a less established cast and characters, some disingenuous elements and cardboard cut-out script-writing then DO NOT WATCH! I don't mind people liking a bit of mindless fun but this is a criminal hatchet-job that does not deserve in any way to parade itself under the title of a classic. Seriously, show some pride! I felt thoroughly justified in my outraged and sickened reaction when I first heard that the film would be made. Avoid at all costs!<br /><br />P.S. Some of the action sequences aren't bad at all so add an extra '1' to the mark if you like this sort of thing.",0
"""The Italian Job"" is a caper movie done by the figures. Riding on the back of every caper cliche, it climbs to no peculiar highlands and will be a movie footnote by about the end of the months.<br /><br />The biggest problem is that ""The Italian Job"" has no fantasy at all. I've seen it all before and done better then. The acting is fine the cinematographic is completely permissible, but this cinematography break altogether no newer overland.<br /><br />Let's tick off the cliches:<br /><br /> - ""old-school"" criminal father figure and his protege<br /><br /> - another gang member jealous of protege<br /><br /> - a double-cross<br /><br /> - only bad guys use guns while good-guy criminals don't have to<br /><br /> - good criminals always outwit the bad guys<br /><br />And that's about the first fifteen minutes. Everything is so foreseeable. Even the heist and car chase scenes, supposedly the highlight of the movie, seem pretty customary. This is especially true since they appeared in the trailers for the film so I already knew what to look for.<br /><br />For me, a caper film works only if it has an element of pragmatism - that maybe, just maybe, it could be pulled off without relying on a deux ex machina or ""just because"" moments. Parts of ""The Italian Job"" just sheds that out the windows, with computers doing things that calculators can't do, the good guys not hitting anyone with their driving (concretely going down the stairs) and not one single police car responding to street explosions, recklessly driven minis or even a low flying helicopter. Must be a heck of a city for these matters not to rate a riposte.<br /><br />The acting is passable, with the crew (Seth Green, Jason Stratham and Mos Def) being at less droll to watch. Mark Wahlberg is just too smarmy as the ""nice guy"" hero while Charlize Theron is about the only actor called on to display some kind of range. Donald Sutherland is a class act as always and exposition up Wahlberg's drawbacks each moment they are together.<br /><br />Overall this is a pretty uninteresting film. Given the IMDb ratings, it's the girls that really love this film, which I can understand to some extent, but there are such better caper films out there - even the vapidness of the recent ""Ocean's Eleven"" outshines the non-event that is ""The Italian Job"".<br /><br />***SPOILER***<br /><br />At the conclusion, take a moment to think about what is going to happen to Norton's character. Are we meant to be cheering the good guys for causing his demise, especially since it would appear to be long and painful? He didn't deserve that, simpering creep that he was.<br /><br />***END SPOILER***",0
"This film did well at the box office, and the growers of this confusion thought the stars had such good chemistry in this that they cast them in the much darker screwball farce, The Gazebo. Sincerely, I am amazed to see all the beneficial comments on this ludicrously plotted unfunny comedy. Both lead characters have the maturity of seven-year-olds and are much less interesting to spend time with. A veteran supporting cast including Fred Clarke, Harry Morgan, and Eva Gabor give magnificent support. And, the beautiful filmmaking certainly makes the rich countryside of Spain seem lush. And, there are four or five truly funny scenes to go with two wise scenes and a whole bunch of recycled and unfunny clutter.<br /><br />I cannot recommends It Started With A Kiss.",0
"I catch 2:37 at the AFI Festival in Los Angeles. It's a very well shot first film (though the DV format begins to show itself in outside scenes), and I'm sure it has good intentions of showing us the ""dark side"" of high school - in other words every side of high school. But the filmmaker doesn't have the talent to write or direct up to the premise's promise. There are several characteristics, but none of them are any more than what the intrigue requiring them to be. There's no depths to these cartoons beyond the machinations of ""I am choppy teen X, I have Y problem."" The levied duties of men and women in this story are phenomenally awkward.<br /><br />Let's start with the men. You have the stoner kid who's gay, the jock who's also gay, the boy who rapes his sister, and Mr. Peepants. As the stereotype requiring, all gay men must be sexually unfulfilled and violent toward women and themselves. Naturally (or unnaturally as the stereotype assumes), the two gay male characters beat up women, Peepants, and themselves. I'd be perfectly fine with these characterizations if the stereotypes were turned on their heads, or if the characters somehow transcended them. Yet neither taken place, and that's all there is to these characters' stories.<br /><br />Next, the ladies. One young woman wants to be a bulimic housewife, another is the pregnant rapee of the sister-raping brother, and there's the girl who kills herself (I'll get to that later). Again, I don't think there's a requirement of political correctness for cinematographers (I'd be out of a job were that the case), but I do thought that it's only justifiable if there's more to that character or story. Unless that archetype were being used to reveal something about character other than ""I'm a teenager and life stinks,"" I'd be happy as a clam. But nothing new is divulged! Nothing is subverted, or changed, or sublimated.<br /><br />Finally, the girl who kills herself. This is blunt and TREMENDOUSLY negligent storytelling. We're supposed to sit through 5 minutes of a girl violently killing herself who we've seen for maybe 30 seconds through the whole film? We've followed all these other stories for an hour and a half, and now we're invited to torture ourselves for a character that isn't part of the story? It's cheap, exploitative, and sloppy. Despite the millions of crappy indie films that came before this, you have to EARN something like that. You can't simply purchase it on credit. So this suicide happens, we get wrap-ups from the characters that go similarly nowhere but down, and the film ends. What have I learned? I already knew high school sucked - been there, done that. I already knew people have stereotypical views of gay men and young women. I already knew that kids with disabilities are mocked.<br /><br />What else is there, then? Smoke, mirrors, and some really nice views of leaves. Oh, and the nastiest deus ex machina I've seen in a while.",0
"I couldn't pertain to this film. I'm surprised that people are lauding it for being so 'realistic'. How many people at your school were victim to incest? How many closet homosexual jocks were there? How many quiet people that you never noticed committed suicide? Hmmm. OK you wouldn't know even if their were. But really these are explosive problems which many us never deal with. And yet there are so many teenagers with subtle problems which could have been explored. But hey, where's the 'entertainment' in that?<br /><br />With regards to the girl who committed suicide - I discoveries this to be exploiter. I actually think MANY people in High School at some stage feel invisible, ignored and unwanted. But what possesses someone to violently commit suicide on just another day of being ignored and unnoticed? The filmmaker decided this girl would suicide to make the film more provocative. And the graphic nature of the suicide to make it even more provocative. I didn't procuring it as a real life scenario.<br /><br />And the problems of the other students I didn't fully relate to. Bullying is explored but that's been done to death, we all know it goes on and it truly is a matter of resolve within that person. Closet homosexuality? Pfft, another clich√© gets rolled out. Thats the thing really, too many clich√©s. I guessed the ending at the start. There was a predictable unpredictability if that makes sense. You've got all these characters with explosive problems, and one with apparently none. And I thought, what is the point of this character unless she's the unsuspecting suicide victim? And surely enough..<br /><br />One thing I will say, and it is the saving grace of the film, is that it does NOT glamourise suicide. The suicide is very graphic and heart-breaking to watch. It is a powerful scene (regardless of how contrived it is)and one that dismisses suicide as the easy option. But the film is really not very imaginative and used stereotypes.<br /><br />Not bad but certainly not groundbreaking OR worthy of a 17-minute standing ovation at Cannes???",0
"Truthfully, Monsieur. Thalluri.... if you do a dramas movies in a high-school setting following a bunch of teenagers through a school day and if you disarray up the time-frame and hop back and forth... if you do that, you can't use the exact same visual tale saying device of ""Elephant"" which is used a camera that is passing of from one character to the next and having scenes revealed 3 times from different corners. You just can't do that because this is such a blunt rip off its tough to think everyone handed this more than a 5 assessment.<br /><br />Whenever ""Phil"" (which was liberated 3 years prior to this movie) using school shootings (or to be exact the Columbine gunshot) as the focal point for its scripts 2:37 utilise teenage kamikaze and seeing the review the shock value of that subject worked. Its the same slow narratives tell, a lots of tremendous piano musica all culminating to a finale you know from the beginning. At fewest the character look like they tried hard to be somewhat different in that department. So you got a untypical gay guy who looks acts like a stoner/skater, a hunky lover-boy who can't deal with his gay side, brother and sister from a rich family who both got their very own problems and here happens the nose dived. <br /><br />You also get a spoiled bulimic dame and one of the most unbecoming attribute ever... a guy with medical conditions who wets his pants because of ""2 urethra syndrome"" who actually never heard of the invention of diapers but rather pisses his pants in the classroom and then change into new clothes and does so EVERY DAY! WHOA, as harsh as this movies endeavour to be realist this is the most claptrap thing I have ever hear. He gets beaten up on the loo and is unmistakably shamed of it but doesn't wipe the blood of his nose when going through the whole school with wet pants and a bleed nose. Becuase new-age reality immediatly leading to ""the twist"" and definitive character who turns out to be the suicidal victims...<br /><br />Upon staring the ""very realist"" life of teens (one day including, incest-rape, teen maternity, bulimia, parental pressure for grades and appearance and the gay subject mentioned before, kind of like your ""very realistic"" daily soap... trying hard to be) we watch a girl die we met once in the beginning of this movie and who has no reason but that the guy she had a crush on left the room when she was talking to him (in a thoughtful piano playing sequence BTW, seen that somewhere before??). And it gets even better... before slitting her wrist in a painful long scene of ""Yes"" and ""No"" she asks 2-urethra-guy if he is OK, constantly smiling and then she cuts her wrist with scissors in a school toilet. <br /><br />Now you got a movie that is a total rip-off of Elephant, fails with some really sloppy story telling (the whole rape-incest thing was pretty unbelievable too by the way) and people call this a shocker.<br /><br />What the heck is going on?? Is all it takes to take some pseudo-dramatic music, boring story telling and adding a shock subject on top and people think there is a major deep message here?? I think Elephant is way overrated already but that movie was the original while this here is an obvious rip-off failing on many more levels. I have never ever seen a more brazen stealing of a whole movie concept in my life... and believe me I watched a hundred of horror movies so I know how low you can go there. This is a total let down in all departments... its nor realistic, its stolen, its damn slow and by all means I wonder whats more useless... another romantic suicide (many give this point to the movie which makes me wonder if they only watch Romeo+Juliet all day long because there is dozens of movies which deal with the subject in a clear non-romantic and MORE REALISTIC way) or this ridiculous set up... Come on! I am still trying to work out if 2-urethra-guy or the suicide itself is more unrealistic and ridiculous.",0
"It is thrilling how this title manages to slip by the average viewer as something new and groundbreaking (quoting some of the comments). Murali K. Thalluri must have figured by himself: ""Oh, excellent! Phil ... What a wondrous cinematic! I'll try difficult to do exactly the same movie and see if anyone notices!"", sadly enough, he even failed with his outrageous idea. The films revolves out a finishes flaw. Considering that it endeavour hard to catch the brilliance of Gus Van Sants ""Elephant"", it makes it look even more absurd - a most inconvenient false pas for a film director.<br /><br />The movie begins off with the suicidal of a student in the schools bathroom. This scene, already, shows the tricky acting proficiency of each one involved in this scene. You don't buy a single word they say. In carries on, discontinued by short interview-styled bits of the kid who ""live on their marrying lives"" with each bit rather distressing in its plain nonsense on the basis of each meaningless monologue. Thalluri modes to introduces the characters this way, to give a kind of fast-as-junk-food insight look into their hearts ... and fail once again. Not five minutes later, Thalluri ultimately shout at the audience ""Yes, people! I steal this movie and for some curious reason, I am proud of it!"" by taking Gus Van Sants most clear narrative style from ""Elephant"": He shot scenes twice to let the viewer follow each character involved in a scene on his particular way and role in a school situation. Hm, doesn't this seem awfully familiar? To me, this certain tier of very forgiving tolerance had been infringed right there to a point at which I couldn't stand this frightful flick any more. Embarrass on you, Murali K. Thalluri, I says! I am principally surprised that ""2:37"" has reached the official selections in Cannes as of 2006, whereas someone must have certainly recalled ""Elephant"" (2003) at the very same Film Festival just a few years ago! So, how in the name of the seigneur did this most ashamed rip-off termination up being shown there? I finds myself altogether bewildered by this mistake.<br /><br />Managers like Thalluri usage the ignorant of audiences who aren't (and cannot completely be) aware of every independent film out there. As Elephant has little to do with mainstream cinema (although it is without a doubt a masterpiece), few people notice that the story as told in ""2:37"" had been told before! How that is possible at a Film Festival of such importance as attributed to Cannes, I cannot say. It is sad and shameful that such things are passed on and hardly anyone sees the true fraud in it.<br /><br />2:37 is by all means solely commercial, worthless as an independent film and (on a certain level) rather a phoney parody of its obvious idol, ""Elephant"".",0
"This movies accomplished me believe....of how I did writing something about it without personally dissing the director and all the players, who, as an Australian, I am proud of for genuinely getting out there and making a movie.<br /><br />But the movies itself? Allowing me say you a story....<br /><br />Found this DVDS in my local leases boutique today and had unclear memento of the exam at the period of theaters freeing here, so I ideas I could give it a go.<br /><br />In some reasons, I opted to watch the 'particular features' before I seen the actual films, not anything that I normally do. Revolved the 'doing of' off halfway through, as I'd had enough cringing at the 'aren't we so wondrous for putting together such a difficult struck film with such a raw script' attitudes.<br /><br />The cinematography? Eurgh. Full of clich√©s and pathetic character evolution. The actresses? Well completed guys, you are Aussies and I applaud you. And, just like a footy team is only as good as the coach that directs them, you unfortunately did NOT have a great script to work with.<br /><br />I felt that the movie actually trivialised so many of the subjects that it seemed to want to cover. I have seen many scrutiny here that refer to it as nothing more than a soap. Agreed.<br /><br />Finally (and forgive me if I don't phrase this correctly), I was extremely disappointed that there were no optimistic overtones at all. Yes, we all know that life is full of hard stuff, and yes we know that things such as incest DO occur, but I genuinely find it hard to applaud a movie that has not one piece of joy in it. I believe that a director has a liability to put it in there SOMEWHERE. Otherwise, the movie is all about THEM and THEIR feelings, they have created it for themselves, not for an audience.<br /><br />Which I think is the basis of why this movie isn't so great. The special features mention that the director wrote the screenplay in a 36 hour sitting, the day after he himself tried to end his own life. Well, it may have been cathartic for him to do this, however the movie smells of self-indulgence when you know the story behind why it was written. ""I feel horrid, I'm going to write a movie about feeling horrid"". (Note: I have read the interview with Andrew Urban, and understand WHY Thalluri needed to write something to help him through his own issues, but I believe there is a line in film that cannot be crossed - the line of making a movie purely for your own emotional needs, and I feel that this is what has unintentionally happened here)<br /><br />By his own admission, the director had no technical experience at all, and sadly, this makes the movie come off looking like nothing more than a year twelve media project.<br /><br />As for any recommendations that this movie should be studied at school, or that all teenagers should watch it - not sure there either. Because there is a VERY dangerous line at the end. I too have been in a place where I have thought that someone who no longer has to 'face life' is 'lucky', but as an adult, I do worry that this line could be influential on a young viewer that was in a vulnerable frame of mind. Might be in there to promote discussion, but again, it reflects no possibility of redemption or joy in this story as a whole. In fact, it almost indicates that there is more sadness to come.<br /><br />I haven't seen Elephant, but I just might go find it, given all the comparisons here.<br /><br />Nothing personal here guys, I do hope you can make another movie someday, and we all have to start out somewhere, so forgive me if I've been too harsh. I am glad that you are proud of what you created, which in the end is what life is all about. It's not a movie I would recommend though.<br /><br />Oh, I DID like the way the time-frames often collided, thought that was an interesting way to film. <br /><br />But the whole ""Its the quiet ones you have to watch"" - we already know that.",0
"There is nothing original,humane or insightful in this film. The acting is average, images are unprofessional, the writes missing subtlety and the scenes are very basic...something close to a soap.<br /><br />In 2:37,a suicide is used to turn the film into a wait drama. We watch, partly, because we want to know who dies. The various characters each have a problem, and the film shows how mala each problem is for them, but only as a way to get them each to a place where you think they might kill themselves. Despite the different points of view offered by the camera on the key phenomena, there is NEVER another way of seeing the events themselves. So in 2:37, the arseholes are arseholes, the angels are angels. This is simple stuff.<br /><br />Without this complication, the film emerges as a voyeuristic storytelling of adolescence sex and violence. You almost get to know the juvenile as much as the breasts, bodies and limps that the filmmaker passes off as characterisation.<br /><br />In the end, if you know ANYTHING about film in the last 5 years, 2:37 is just an immature tear off of Phil - not a reflection, not a progression. However while the filmmaker and distributor use the alleged suicide of a friend at every chance to give the film some legitimacy, they never talk about Gus Van Sant or Elephant. The positive posts on IMDb curiously avoid any mention of this, or simply don't values originality. If you do want something with heart and voice - avert this slice of youth operate. I was surprised by the filmmakers age when I found out after seeing this film - I had assumed a 13 year old had made it. The Twenty Somethings I've always known are too busy trying to express something real in them to lift the work of an old man.",0
"... Said the continuity announcer as TACTICAL ASSAULT was about to be broadcast . After seeing the first two minutes I started thinking Rutger might want to get a new agent . After seeing the next ten minutes I started think Rutger might want to retire thereby saving a potential audience from any more of his performances <br /><br />Yep this is a genuinely frightful cinematography . I wasn't expecting much and why should I if the name Rutget Hauer appeared in the credits , but within seconds of the opening title credits that featured NATO warplanes with USSR brand blasts Bosnia I grasped I was going to be force fed inedible turkeys three month after Claus .<br /><br />The attention to detail is non existent . NATO planes carry SOVIET markings then were told Hauer's character spent six years in an Baghdad prison which would make the setting 1997 . What NATO were bombing the Serbian in 1997 ! I guess the producers didn't think the audience would have noticed this nonsense inaccuracy but I know I did . The producers also probably hoped the audience wouldn't notice the lack of continuity such as dogfights with Iraqi jets that suddenly turned from Migs to F-4 Phantoms then back again but I did . Even stranger characters would take off in F-16s then when they arrive back at base there jet has changed into a Soviet built Mig <br /><br />Oh and if you're expecting a dumb action movie you're only half right because it's dumb but most of the plot centres around a BASIC INSTINCT retribution plot . I'll give the producers some credit ( Maybe credit is too strong a word ) because after seeing plots featuring nannies from hell , policemen from hell , flat mates from hell we now have a fighter pilot from hell which means each single occupation of the 20th century has featured in a from hell type plot with maybe TATICAL ASSUALT being the hardest cinematography of the lot",0
"It's as if the Stay-Puffed Marshmallow Man from Ghostbusters had been reincarnated in Rutger Hauer's body and is taking revenge upon a rival's pregnant wife! If seeing an obese Hauer chase a very pregnant Isabel Glaser (imagine the spine-tingling thrills in that contest) sounds good to you, see this film! Seriously, if Hauer is what an Iraqi POW looks like after six years in prison, then hungry people everywhere should make a bee line to a jail in Baghdad. Overall ""Tactical Assault"" rate 2 stars instead of 1 because Mike Mitchell as Hawk is wondrous. Mitchell burns up the screen as a NATO pilot until his plane is burned up itself (by an enemy missle), whereupon the film loses what little verve it had to begin with.",0
"This movie is splendidly poor. It was on television when I tuned in during an action scene and was chuckling away at the cheesy macho discussions, waiting for Leslie Nielsen to appear. It took me a couple of minutes to realise that it wasn't actually a comedy, it was meant to be taken seriously. What has to be remembered is that somebody actually sat down and wrote this movie, and worse still - other people funded it and gave it the green light.<br /><br />Rutger Hauer obviously doesn't read movie scripts before he signs up, either that or he has some seriously bad debts to pay.<br /><br />Strangely, this film is so poor, that you find yourself staring at it, wondering how it actually got funded, and how a TV channel must have paid money for the rights to air it. The discussions between hero and baddie whereas trying to shoot each other out of the sky is peculiarly painful, with dialogue sounding like it was generated by a Texas Intruments ""Speak & Spell"".<br /><br />The Hollywood money machine at it's hardest. Droll though.",0
"Well, this movie shows us that Mark Griffiths and producers think we all are fools. If not how should we understand this:<br /><br />American pilots take off on Mig-29s. Suddenly all aircrafts turn to F-16s. Had, a wizardry! Upon an action... Migs land. The magic again!<br /><br />Oh, did I mention that F-16s had Israel markings? <br /><br />Another quadrant: obviously unarmed L-39 trainers are bombing enemies.<br /><br />And more magic: while all movie is situated in Europe, we can see a desert in almost any flying scene.<br /><br />Maybe the headmaster wasted all his magic on things above, because action scenes are tremendously chaotic and also bombings look frightfully as if pilots bombarded with molotovs.<br /><br />OK, OK, this is a movie. I should write about its tales... awaits. A conte? Yes there is SOME story in this cinematography. And its heinous as well.",0
"*** Possable spoiler but probably not ***<br /><br />The game is called donkey kong but donkey kong is not even in it<br /><br />anymore!

"Most Lorne Michaels films seem to fail because they're essentially just extended versions of skits that barely managed to make people laugh in five-minute segments. ""Tommy Boy"" is a character right from ""SNL"" - a big fat lovable (in their opinion) goof who doesn't know anything.<br /><br />David Spade gets the Thankless Overwhelmed Everyman role. He's paired with the Annoying Overweight Slob and they endure Miserable Misfortunes as they travel cross country to Save Daddy's Business.<br /><br />The plot, for starters, is really faulty. The whole premise - daddy dies and rich stupid son has to save the family biz - can be traced back to just about any movie you want. Like any SNL style film it is reduced to a simple motivation - empty, shallow; just a reason to see a fat guy and a thin guy be ""funny"" together.<br /><br />The movie's biggest ""influence"" is the 1987 comedy classic ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles."" That movie is great because the plot isn't stale and recycled. It's basic, yeah - a guy traveling home for Thanksgiving gets stuck with a slob. But it's authentic, dammit. It makes all the difference. The characters are real, the situations are far more real. ""Tommy Boy"" is pure slapstick and its ridiculous situations undermine the characters - we feel nothing for them, and we don't care about what's happening on-screen. ""PTA"" walked the careful line between outrageous and utterly believable and relate-able - ""Tommy Boy"" is simply absurd, with jokes like a simple deer-in-the-headlights turning into a crash turning into a struggle with a dead deer that really isn't dead, then awakens and wrecks their car.<br /><br />The whole wrecked car thing is stolen completely from ""PTA"" and it's eerie how much stuff in this film actually does resemble the Steve Martin/John Candy movie.<br /><br />Farley is simply way too obnoxious to find likable - I've never enjoyed watching him in any movies and this hasn't changed my mind. Spade's given very little to do, serving as the movie's most thankless character.<br /><br />Dan Aykroyd is wasted as the Evil Baddie who plans to destroy Daddy's Business. The ending is a joke, and not in a ""har-har funny"" way. More like a ""oh god are they serious?!"" way.<br /><br />Some people dig it, that's cool. But I just can't get into it, nor do I appreciate all the stuff it ""borrows"" from - not just counting ""PT&A"" - without any credit whatsoever.",0
"Physical Evidence is one of those films that you want to like but really should be a lot better than it actually is. Crafted as a sequel to Jagged Edge for Glenn Close and Robert Loggia, it gives the impression that all involved only made it while they were waiting for something better to come along. The supposition is absolutely actionable, it's mostly technically effective if horribly uninspired with even Henry Mancini's musacky score surprisingly pleasant, but you can't help feeling that things would have turned out better if one of the leads had turned out to be the killer (as is rumoured was originally the case). As the opening scene of his little-seen, personally disastrous Heat (1986) showed, Reynolds has all the makings of a great screen villain. As is, there are few stuns and a feeling of half-hearted filming by numerals as it constructed up a head of intertia as it ambles disinterestedly towards a less than grand will-this-do? finale.<br /><br />Reynolds is fine, sailing through on charisma in what is clearly a star vehicle. Regrettably, the same cannot be said of Tereza Russell. An phenomenal and gutsy actress in husband Nic Roeg's cinematic which allow her to delve into the darker side of human nature, she's trapped in a part that requires star quality rather than depth, and she ain't got it in spades. She doesn't fluff her lines or bump into the other actors, but that's about all that can be said in favour of her astonishingly stilted and often amateurish performance that enabled the film down desperately. Aside from Ned Beatty's prosecutor the supporting cast add only a slightly surreal presence in a Boston where everyone seems to have a badly disguised Canadian accent and the streets bear a startling resemblance to Toronto and Montreal.<br /><br />Likewise, director Michael Crichton, who in Westworld, Coma and The First Great Train Robbery showed that he knew how to lean an audience to the edge of their seats, seems to handle the action in a purely perfunctory fashion - indeed, in one brief chase the shots don't even match and seem thrown together almost arbitrarily. The climax itself has no flair and is completely bereft of threat or danger, and many scenes are played for far less than they are worth. It's no wondrous surprise that, aside from uncredited reshoots on The 13th Warrior, Crichton hasn't directed since.<br /><br />Its watchable enough in an 80s TV movie sort of way, even if it never lives up to the promise of its opening. Whether that's enough of a reason to see it is down to individual taste.",0
"I got a kick out of Reynolds saying to his attorney, ""look,I've done a lot of shi%ty thing in my life, but I never killed anyone."" Obviously he forgot about his career which slid down shan after he started making twit movies like 'Cannonball Run.' Physical Evidence was originally supposed to be a sequel to 'The Jagged Edge' that Glen Close sanely rejected. The verdict is in, avoid Physical Evidence.",0
"This really is a film of two halves. The first detailing the lives and friendship of two boys (one a privileged Pashtun and the other a down-trodden Hazara) in late 70s Afghanistan before the invasion by the USSR works extremely well. The young actors turn in convincing performances and seeing Afghanistan as it once was throws the present situation there into stark relief.<br /><br />The real difficulties comes when we move into the later phase of the story where we join the Pashtun as a man living in America. Ancient debts to his young friend lead him to return to his homeland and it is really at this point that things outage down. The central adult character is clearly supposed to be sympathetic, but in fact comes across as wimpish and wallowing in self pity. It is hard to really care for him and one cannot help but feel that the really interesting story is the one we do not get to see - that of his boyhood friend.<br /><br />Once he returns to Afghanistan the narrative becomes bogged down in a series of highly contrived coincidences. Most remarkably he manages to come across his childhood enemy after all these years almost immediately (even though he is not looking for him), despite the chaos that has since consumed the country. This enables him to confront past demons in a way that is simply too convenient to be credible. The resolution of the narrative is also run through with an heinous, maudlin sentimentality which undermines any really serious points the film may be trying to make.<br /><br />Although it is possible to start seeing characters and the abuses of their lives as symbols of a state which has been torn apart by world politics it is hard to really see this as a film which engages with any wider political discussion. Instead the narrative becomes reduced to one character's emotional journey of self discovery and healing. Sadly this character is so boring and wrapped up in himself that it is hard to really become engaged in his story, while opportunities to make a really interesting film about Afghanistan itself are wasted.",0
"The Kite Runner began as one of those ""important"" films that most people fawn over because they are told that they should if they want to be among the elite and promptly descend into an nonsensical film of absurdly outlandish proportions.<br /><br />I've never read the book, and never felt the need because I honestly don't care. Sure I'm called uninformed for saying it but I truly have no interest whatsoever in just another ""pull at your heartstrings, copy off of all other story lines to get emotion from the readers"" novel, even if it is set in Afghanistan.<br /><br />That said, I watched the movie. I listened buena things about its beauty, and how touching it was and decided why not? As it turns out, there was a very good reason why not. Not only was the so called main character completely unsympathetic (I get it, he was young and this is a film about redemption but honestly he was spooky. I hated him and not in that good 'Anti-hero' way, he was just a dull, idiotic, self-absorbed character that I felt nothing towards) but the rest of the story was so completely nutty that I couldn't believe how everyone else was fawning over how splendid it was, and how they cried and it moved them. I'm sorry, but I only feel moved by something that feels realistic, Sci-Fi has been known to move me, fantasy as well...but this? Please. This surpassed many other movies for pure absurdity! My biggest peeve, Hassan was Amir's brother...really? You sure you didn't just rip that off from a thousand other stories? Positive that that particular tidbit wasn't just added in to try to pull more tears out of your audiences (y'know the type of people who look for reasons to cry during a movie)? I was rolling my eyes when that ""twist"" was revealed knowing that it could only go downhill from there (not to mention flashing back to Star War ""Amir, Hussein is your brother"" ""NOOOoo, that's not true, that's IMPOSSIBLE!"") Ah, and it definitely did. Filled to the brim with clich√©'s and just plan twit storytelling. Like ""good dawg miraculously escapes bad guy against all odds with help from spunky kid who despite being viciously sodomized and having no clue who you are is willing to help out with a conveniently placed weapon that holds special meaning to you"". Ooh and don't forget the oh so idiotic ""finally getting vengeance on the kid who teased you when you were little who, surprise surprise, has turned into a psychopathic adult"" (trust me guys, I understand you like to live vicariously through movies but that'll never happen. You know that kid who teased you in high school...he's no terrorist, he's probably an accountant.) <br /><br />Oh, and I must mention the CGI-tastic kites! I think those were on par with the ""Matrix"" movies and ""Transformers"" bravo you guys! BRAVO!<br /><br />It seems this movie was just made for western audiences who need to a reason to care about the Middle East (hey an overly emotional friendship story will work!) This is one of the most shallow movies I've had the misfortune of seeing, it poses as deep well...but when you get right down to it, it's nothing special.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the core of America's audience will do what they're told and follow the ""It's about controversial material so it must be good!"" way of thinking.",0
"Honestly I am not THAT impressed by it, it's not a bad movie, but it's not great one either. There's a story to tell, but it's told in a very inconsistent way which kinds of makes it lax it's full meaning and proficiency to intrigue. This movie could of been made in another way with an wondrous result, the story is just so interesting yet somehow I'm not intrigued when watching it. <br /><br />It definitely isn't an amateurs movie, rather the opposite and some of the scenes are really emotional. The actors and actresses does quite a good job and so does the director but there's just something so unfinished by the whole movie that I cant quite put my finger on. Perhaps if you had gotten to know the characters abit more, all the 'messiness' of the movie could of been better clarified and put more 'action' throughout it cause as it was, it became abit slow from time to time.",0
"Rented this one by mistake thinking it was another film with the same title, and realizing that I had rented it some time before.<br /><br />Speedy plot line. A couple consisting of an artist and photographer rent a studio apartment in Los Angeles from Joe Estevez, still cursing the fact his brother Martin Sheen could actually ACT! They find a bed in a forgotten room, but the bed is haunted by a nasty looking serial killer from the 1930's and his last victim. Their ghosts inhabit the couple, first enhancing their sex life, but eventually becoming more menacing.<br /><br />What ensues is inexpensive R-rated sex scenes, cheaper thrills and kind of a wastes of time.",0
"The plot seemed to be interesting, but this film is a wondrous dissapointment. Bad actors, a camera moving like in the hands of an amateur. If there was C-movies, this would be a perfect example. A plus for a nice DVD cover though and a great looking female actor.",0
"Unless you're interested in seeing 2 hours worth of scenic mountain footage featuring hysterical characters, lots of histrionics and inexpensive 70s gore (not much of it either), I would advise to avoidance this movie. It is long bushed, overlong and has a rather irritating amateurish feel to it. Masterpiece? Nos, an average thriller, offed in an average fashion, in a wondrous Ltalian panorama. <br /><br />I'm a huge fan of slow paced 1970 movies, when there is a plot to delight and entertain you. In this case, it didn't work out for me. The plot is trite, interlaced with shallow and stereotypical personages, supported by hilarious furious mobs and your typical Italian widows dressed all in black, sobbing.<br /><br />If you are not acquainted and familiar with the Italia country side, the movie might be worth seeing as the scenery itself is terrific and rather breathtaking. This movie isn't still, nothing out of the ordinary, there are much better Italian horror flicks than this. Not much further than a yawn fest. 5/10",0
"Try as I might, I just simply couldn't get into this one. Perhaps it was the scrubbed out tones; perhaps it was the drawn-out approach--I'm not really sure, but though this was by no means a ""bad"" cinema, I didn't really find it to be very much of an ""effectively"" movie (words that I understand are so much more arbitrary than their common uses).<br /><br />So, basically, the deal here is that a series of adolescent boys' deaths sets off an investigation and anxiety in a small provincial town, triggering a witch hunt. What do the boys' death have to do with the mysterious, sexy woman who has appeared in town? Is the crazy hermit woman involved? Is it voodoo? The tales is a blend of crime opera and terror as the various townsfolk are all suspected and corpses keep appearing while homicidal violence ensues.<br /><br />Good satisfactorily, but to me, most of it decreased a little flat. Oh, it had it's moments... the one boy walking in on a beautiful naked seductress was quite good, and the scene where the fathers beat the hermit was a bitter comment (even if the consequences themselves failed, considering her skin seemed to peel off as if they were whipping her with red-hot irons).<br /><br />My biggest issue was the ending. I've already put spoiler tags on this review, but BE WARNED, HERE'S THE BIG SPOILER: I don't reckon it. I don't believe that a orator could convince himself to kill young boys for becoming sexually aware without some hint of that psychosis appearing earlier, with other boys, with a history, or some other personal affect. The films didn't really gain its ending. END SPOILERS.<br /><br />Nonetheless, Fulci is a big name and I'm more than certain there's an audience out there for this. I admittedly needs to checking out more that he's done, because this may have been a poor introduction. Most Italian giallo is hit-or-miss anyway, so I'm expecting to see what else this buddy can do before handwriting him off.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB",0
"A frustrating documentary. Luiz Kahn's sons, who saw his father only minimally during his childhood because he was a member of just one of the three separate families his father had created, takes on the tasks of trying to learnt more about his father through an exploration of his structure and his life. It sounds like a whopping idea for a documentation, but it ends up flat and uninteresting.<br /><br />Sadly, the fundamental difficulty is that Kahn's yarns, Nathaniel, is not just one of the film's protagonists --- he is apart director, writer, maker, interviewer and narrator. Nathaniel seem both too inexperienced and perhaps too close to the material to function well in any of these roles. Else, while he seems like a pleasurable enough guy, he doesn't have much screen involvements, so the facto that he is the only unchanging in the kino becomes wearing. <br /><br />Nathaniel apart arises across as an unprepared and unprofessional interviewer --- there are many points where an interviewee makes an interesting or inflammatory statement and the cameras cuts to a shot of Mak offering little more than a blank stare and a sort of timid ""uh-huh,"" as if he's a small freaked that he's going to have to come up with something to say in response. At times, I felt ashamed watching people who apt have had honestly interesting matters to say about Kahn (or at least best things to do with their time) glaring to realize that they were in the hands of an interviewer who was going to depend on them to direct the conversation. <br /><br />Nathaniel's double role as both documentarian and lost son seem to do more to harmed the film than helped. One senses that some of the interviewees are a little reluctant to really openings up about negative things of Kahn's persona and professions, reportedly because it's not clear from Nathaniel whether he's looking to dig into the truth or simply wanting to hear enjoyable story about his Dad -- ideally ones that will confirms his hope that his Dad really did care more for Nathaniel and his mother than seems apt. His passive approach as an interviewer may stems directly from this conflict. The only individuals Mak does push is his own mamas, but those debates tend to feel a little like unfavourable adolescent tragedy (Aren't you UPSET, Mommy?"") and don't affords much in terms of aiding us (or Nathaniel) understand Kahn or the loyalty he evoked from those around him. <br /><br />What the film desperately lacks is shaping by an experienced and independent hand, not to exclude Nathaniel, but to balance his subjectivity and inexperience. An independent director could have stood away from the material, given more thought to what the interviewees could contribute and, one hopes, cut out those portions of the documentary process that just don't work, such as the weird segment with the guy who claims to have see Kahn die (which made it look as if Nathaniel was just being taken in by some loony) or the entire bit about hooking up with Kahn's first cousin, who had nothing to add about Kahn or Nathaniel. Too many times Nathaniel makes us watch him standing in or near a Kahn building buttonholing strangers to tell them that his father was the designer. (Ahhh¬Ö huh. Thaaat's nice, sir. Umm¬ÖI gotta go now.) I understand why these things might be important to Nathaniel and that showing the documentary process is sometimes interesting, but this is one of those examples of when a documentary can be TOO personal.<br /><br />As an aside, I thought the score written for the film was great! (But, one of the oddest moments in the entire thing for me was when, during the tour of the Kimball Art Museum, the voice-over quotes Kahn as making a comparison between architecture and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. The music being played at the same time? Beethoven's NINTH Symphony. A mistake? A miscue? Who knows? It did make me laugh.) <br /><br />Kahn was a great architect and it's clear that he was an unusual human being and had an intriguing life story. There's definitely a good documentary to be made about him. One is sympathetic to Nathaniel's search for the father he didn't know, but I'm not sure whether THAT is an interesting story. Neither works so well in this film.",0

"Although there is very little plot and whatever exists is just all improvisational, still it was a good begins from a new director with no previous financial back up and also a intelligent move from Andy Warhol to make his cimematic productions more marketable and viewer-friendly. In any case this story of a street hustler relies too much on showing Joe buck naked (almost all the time!). And the inventive use of a flashy editing truthfully wearing off after the hundredth time and the cutting off the dialog thing gets really annoying half-way. This would have been a much more entertaining or even dramatic if they made a documentary of the daily of an actual male prostitute or hustler, instead of letting the actors make up some nonesensical plot and dialog of their own.",0
